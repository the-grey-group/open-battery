for electric vehicles has exploded in recent years. More than 740,000
electric vehicles were on the road in January 2015, a number expected
to reach several million by 2020.</p><p>Lithium-ion batteries will
likely power all of those cars. Other battery technologies such as
lithium&#x02013;sulfur and magnesium-ion are in the works, but none
are close to dethroning lithium-ion. &#x0201c;Lithium-ion is pulling
away, and everything else is in the rearview mirror&#x0201d;, says <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dmse.mit.edu/faculty/profile/chiang">Yet-Ming Chiang</ext-link>, a materials science and engineering professor at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.</p><p>Lithium-ion batteries have come a long
way since Sony first sold them in 1992 for consumer electronics. Today,
they hold more than double the energy by weight. Also their cost per
kilowatt-hour has dropped to $300, a third of what it was in 2008.
But to get electric vehicles into the driveways of more people, manufacturers
will need cheaper batteries with a 300-plus-mile driving range.</p><p>Achieving that range from a single charge requires a battery with
high energy density. Researchers are pushing for such densities by tinkering with the battery&#x02019;s electrode chemistries.</p><p>Inside a typical lithium-ion cell, an electrolyte-soaked separator
sits between an anode and cathode. Ions flow from the anode to the
cathode during discharge and shuttle back when the battery recharges.
The anode in present-day batteries is typically made of graphite,
while the electrolyte is a lithium salt in an organic solvent.</p><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="oc-2015-002239_0001" id="fx1" position="float"><caption><p>An all-electric Tesla Model S charges its batteries while

materials and largely determines a battery&#x02019;s performance. The
energy stored in the cathode depends on the material&#x02019;s charge-storage
capacity and the voltage it needs to absorb and release lithium ions,
explains <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eetd.lbl.gov/people/vincent-battaglia">Vincent S. Battaglia</ext-link>, head of the electrochemical technologies
group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. So researchers&#x02019;
goal is to develop cathode materials with high capacities and voltages.</p><p>This can be tricky, he says. Any new electrode material has to
be stable but also work well with other battery components. One example
of a stability problem is collapse of the cathode material&#x02019;s
crystal structure when lithium ions flow out of it. This can reduce
the electrode&#x02019;s lithium-storage capacity over time or cause
it to break down. As for issues with other battery components, if
a cathode operates at too high a voltage, it can oxidize and decompose
the liquid electrolyte. Other unwanted reactions between the cathode
and electrolyte can lead to corrosion of the cathode or deposition of current-reducing
layers on its surface.</p><p>Batteries in cell phones and laptops
use lithium cobalt oxide cathodes, which have a high energy density
of 150&#x02013;190 Wh/kg. But the material&#x02019;s high price tag
and low stability make it unsuitable for the large battery packs needed
in electric vehicles. So researchers have in recent years made stable
cathode materials by replacing some of the cobalt with elements like
nickel and manganese.</p><p>One promising material is lithium nickel
manganese cobalt (NMC). It has an energy density of 140&#x02013;180
Wh/kg and can be charged twice as many times as lithium cobalt oxide
before losing its capacity. A typical electric vehicle battery goes
through 1,500 cycles. Electric cars such as the Nissan Leaf and BMW
i3 use NMC batteries.</p><p>The Tesla Model S, meanwhile, runs on
lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) batteries made by Panasonic.
This new cathode material boasts an energy density greater than 240
Wh/kg, but it is relatively expensive and requires oversized liquid-cooled
battery packs to prevent overheating.</p><p>The hunt for new cathode
materials now involves tweaking the composition of existing materials.
Most efforts are focused on the next generation of NMC materials.
The auto industry&#x02019;s thrust is to increase the nickel content
in NMC compounds, because nickel allows the cathode to operate at
a high voltage, Chiang says. Current NMCs have equal parts by weight
of nickel, manganese, and cobalt, but the industry is now looking
at ratios of 5-to-2-to-3 or 6-to-2-to-2.</p><p>Researchers at Argonne
National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, meanwhile,
are trying to improve a lithium- and manganese-rich NMC cathode that
promises 280 Wh/kg energy density but currently suffers from a voltage
drop over time.</p><p>While cathodes take up a large share of research,
scientists are also looking at new anode chemistries. Major battery
makers as well as some startups want to swap graphite anodes with
silicon, which has 10 times the charge-storage capacity. Silicon swells
drastically when it absorbs lithium ions, so the anodes degrade after
a few hundred recharge cycles. Researchers are trying to limit the
swelling with tricks such as combining silicon with graphite or graphene,
embedding it in protective coatings, or using silicon nanostructures.
A few research groups are also looking at anodes made of pure lithium
metal and of graphene.</p><p>It is hard to predict which lithium-ion
battery chemistry will increase the driving ranges and lower the costs
of electric vehicles. But it is clear that chemists have their work
cut out for them. &#x0201c;A battery is more than just a collection
of materials: It&#x02019;s a system&#x0201d;, Chiang says. &#x0201c;The
materials have to work together. That&#x02019;s one of the most challenging
aspects of battery development.&#x0201d;</p><p><italic>Prachi Patel
