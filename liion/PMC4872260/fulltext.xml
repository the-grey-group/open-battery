To serve these purposes, it is pivotal to improve various performance attributes of lithium-ion batteries such as capacity, safety, cyclability and high rate capability. The main reaction for lithium-ion batteries is the charge transfer reaction where both lithium ions and electrons react with each other. To improve this reaction site and storage capacity for practical use, composite electrodes comprising active materials, carbon and binder are widely used in lithium-ion batteries as shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. It is well known that their morphology influences the electrochemical performance of batteries. For the improvement of performance in practically used lithium-ion batteries, it is necessary to tune the parameters of composite electrodes such as porosity, compounding ratio and thickness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, even though many research works have been performed in lithium-ion batteries field, the tuning of composite electrodes has been performed on an empirical basis. This is because determining factors in tuning composite electrodes have not been clearly understood. From a practical standpoint, it is quite essential to scientifically develop the design guide for composite electrodes.</p><p>In composite electrodes, electrons and lithium-ions are supplied from current collectors and electrolyte side, respectively shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. In their conduction paths, there are a number of internal resistances inherent in the composite electrode. The electronic conduction is influenced by metallic and film resistances in aluminum, and carbon and surface resistances of active materials. The ionic conduction is related with ionic resistance in electrolyte and solid state diffusion in active materials. Since the electrode reaction occurs preferentially in regions with lower resistance, reaction distribution might be happened within composite electrodes in depth direction especially in large-scale lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>The reaction distribution depends on engineering parameters such as material composition, morphology, porosity in composite electrodes. The morphology of composite electrodes varies the effective electronic and ionic conductivity in composite electrodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. However the tuning of composite electrodes has been mainly based on the intuition and experiences, since it is difficult to distinguish the electronic conductivity and the ionic conductivity in composite electrodes. For composite electrodes, the traditional 4-probe method cannot be applied because charge-discharge currents are flew during applying voltage.</p><p>For the design principle of composite electrodes, it is essential to understand the relationship among battery performance, reaction distribution and electronic/ionic conductivity in composite electrodes. Previously some researchers have studied the distribution model from the theoretical aspect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. There are a few reports made to directly observe the reaction distribution of composite electrodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. More recently, <italic>in situ</italic> observations of reaction distribution have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Unfortunately these advanced studies observed distribution phenomena without experimentally addressing the decision factor for the distribution and electrode performance. This study aims to explain their relationship from the experimental results. As the representative engineering parameters, the porosity in composite electrodes is varied. The rate performance, the cross-sectional reaction distribution and electronic/ionic conductivity in various porous composite electrodes are experimentally measured. To investigate the cross-sectional reaction distribution occurring in composite electrodes, two-dimensional (2D) imaging X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) technique is applied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. For the measurement of electronic/ionic conductivity in composite electrodes, we have developed a method for simultaneous measurement of electronic and ionic conductivities in composite electrodes. The knowledge is useful to understand the decision factor for charge-discharge performance in lithium-ion batteries and design principle of composite electrodes in any electrochemical devices.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>As the representative parameter, the relationship between electrode porosity and discharge capacity at 10 C rate was examined. This study used LiFePO<sub>4</sub> composite electrodes. Porosity of composite electrodes was varied by changing pressures of a roll press. The cross-sectional SEM images of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> composite electrodes pressed at various pressures and their porosity are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>. The difference in porosity, pore size and adhesion exerts influence on the electrochemical characteristics. Discharge curves for LiFePO<sub>4</sub> electrodes with different porosities at 10 C rate are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>. The discharge capacity is increased with the increasing porosity from 36% to 56%. A sharp decrease of the voltage at the terminal of the discharge profile is observed for low porosity electrodes (36% and 41%). The equilibrium potential of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> is about 3.45&#x02009;V<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The voltage drop from the equilibrium potential is mainly termed as ohmic drop, which is influenced by the internal resistance of the battery. A lower discharge voltage demonstrates a large IR drop for the high porosity electrodes (56% and 48%). The porosity of composite electrode impacts on the high rate discharge behavior. In the following study, we investigate the reaction distribution from the current collector to electrode surface and the effective electronic and ionic conductivity in the composite electrodes.</p><p>As the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> electrode is discharged, the absorption energy of the Fe-<italic>K</italic>edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) decreases as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. By using two-dimensional detector, we can obtain special resolved XAS spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). Mapping the absorption energy as a function of pixel position provides the information about cross-sectional reaction distribution of the electrodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Sample for this mesurement is explained in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3a</xref> shows the cross-sectional reaction distribution mappings of the electrodes with different porosities discharged to the nominal composition of Li<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>FePO<sub>4</sub> approached <italic>x</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.45 at 10 C rate. The color changes from blue to red represent that the absorption energy decreases corresponding to the discharge reaction taking place. Therefore, the transition from blue to red in the color bars indicates that the discharge reaction proceeds. Apparently inhomogeneous reaction is caused especially for low porosity electrodes. The absorption edge energy as a function of distance from current collector for various pressed electrodes is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>. When the porosity of the electrode is 44%, 41%, 36%, the reaction occurs preferentially from electrode/electrolyte interface. However, when the porosity of the electrode is 56% or 48%, the uniform reaction is achieved. The reaction distribution in depth direction has been reported in the active materials with mono-phasic reaction such as LiCoO<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> and LiNi<sub>1/3</sub>Co<sub>1/3</sub>Mn<sub>1/3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>The impact of porosity on cross-sectional reaction distribution can be attributed to the effective ionic and electronic conductivities. In order to measure the effective ionic and electronic conductivities, we have developed a method for simultaneous measurement of electronic and ionic conductivities in composite electrodes based on the proposed principle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4a</xref> shows the measurement setup and the arrangement of the electrodes and samples. The electrochemical cell contains 6 probes connecting with the composite electrode. For the electronic and the ionic conduction electrodes, Al foils and Li foils were used, respectively. Sample detail is explained in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S5</xref>. Two potentiostats and bias voltage were connected to the cell. After open circuit voltage was measured, the two potentiostats were operated with this voltage as the set point. And then, a bias voltage was applied between the two working electrodes. In this case, the potential though the composite electrode was kept as the setting voltage as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>. The ionic current was measured at A1 current meter, and the electronic current was measured at A2 current meter. By using Ohm&#x02019;s law and the definition of conductivity we can calculate the electronic and ionic conductivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S6</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4c,d</xref> shows the effective electronic and ionic conductivities for various porosity composite electrodes. The electronic conductivity is at least 10 times higher than the ionic conductivity, which implies the dominant contribution of the ionic conduction to the electrochemical performance. For the high porosity electrodes, the effective ionic conductivity is almost constant. When the porosities of the electrodes are less than 47%, the ionic conductivity decreased. This result indicates that the effective ionic conductivity is decreased due to the narrow and distorted ion diffusion paths within the composite electrodes. The narrow and distorted pores impede movement of lithium ions and produce a concentration gradient within the composite electrode, consequently leading to large concentration polarization especially in the end of discharge reaction. On the other hand, the electronic conductivity decreases with increasing porosity. The effective electronic conductivity for high porosity electrodes is low due to poor contact of particles, as apparent in the SEM images (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1</xref>). Poor conductive networks cause relatively high ohmic drop in the discharge reaction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>. The electronic conductivity of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> is about 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02212;1&#x02009;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> which is much lower than the layered oxide, LiCoO<sub>2</sub> (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> S cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. However, in the practical applications, LiFePO<sub>4</sub> of nano-sized particles is used with carbon coating. In this case, the electronic conductivity of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> itself does not govern the rate capability.</p><p>The experimental data for the reaction distribution and the effective electronic/ionic conductivity reveals the reaction phenomena in composite electrodes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref> shows a schematic of ionic and electrical potentials within a composite electrode. Difference between ionic potential and electrical potential is the driving force for the electrode reaction. For low porosity electrodes, ionic potential has a sharp inclination due to a low effective ionic conductivity. As noted above, the low effective ionic conductivity is ascribed to a narrow and distorted pore. On the other hand, electrical potential remain constant at all depths due to a high effective electronic conductivity. As a result, the difference between ionic potential and electrical potential at the surface of the electrode is larger than at the side of current collector. As such, for low porosity electrodes, the reaction occurs preferentially from electrode/electrolyte interface. For high porosity electrodes, the variation of ionic potential is small owing to a high effective ionic conductivity. Large pore size and the favorable path of lithium ion lead to a high effective ionic conductivity. Furthermore, the electrical potential variation is also small because the effective electronic conductivity is enough compared with the ionic conduction. The difference between ionic potential and electrical potential remains constant at all depths in composite electrodes and a uniform reaction is achieved. Therefore, the cross-sectional reaction distribution depends on the effective ionic conductivity and governs the electrochemical properties in composite electrodes. During charge-discharge reaction, the volume change between LiFePO<sub>4</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub> might influence the battery performances especially in highly pressed electrodes. If the volume change governs the rate performance, the reaction distribution in depth direction is not caused, which is not consistent with the reaction distribution observed in the low porosity electrodes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have experimentally investigated the cross-sectional reaction distribution and the effective electronic/ionic conductivity of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> composite electrodes with various porosities in lithium-ion batteries. Composite electrodes with low porosity cause a large polarization in high rate discharge reaction and decrease their capacity. In these electrodes, the discharge reaction occurs preferentially at the top surface of the electrode near electrolyte side. Further, low porosity results in a low effective ionic conductivity. This study clearly reveals the ionic conduction in the composite electrodes is the governing factor of lithium-ion battery performance. Control of ionic conductivities in composite electrodes is important to further improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><p>The active material, carbon-coated LiFePO<sub>4</sub> powder, with an average particle size of 200&#x02009;nm was used.
