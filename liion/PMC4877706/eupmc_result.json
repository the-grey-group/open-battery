    "A novel one-step hydrothermal and calcination strategy was developed to synthesize the unique 1D oriented Co3O4 crystal nanofibers with (220) facets on the carbon matrix derived from the natural, abundant and low cost wool fibers acting as both carbon precursor and template reagent. The resultant W2@Co3O4 nanocomposite exhibited very high specific capacity and favorable high-rate capability when used as anode material of lithium ion battery. The high reversible Li(+) ion storage capacity of 986 mAh g(-1) was obtained at 100 mA g(-1) after 150 cycles, higher than the theoretical capacity of Co3O4 (890 mAh g(-1)). Even at the higher current density of 1 A g(-1), the electrode could still deliver a remarkable discharge capacity of 720 mAh g(-1) over 150 cycles."
