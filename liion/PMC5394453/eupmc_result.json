    "Triple-shelled ZnFe2O4 hollow microspheres (ZFO) as anode materials for lithium ion battery are prepared through a one-pot hydrothermal reaction using the composite solution consisting of sucrose in water and metal ions in ethylene glycol (EG), followed by different calcination processes. The architectures of ZFO micro spheres are differently synthesized through a mutual cooperation of inward and outward ripening with three different calcination temperatures. Thin triple-shelled ZnFe2O4 hollow microspheres calcined at 450 °C (ZFO-450) delivers a high reversible capacity of 932 mA h g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1 even at the 200th cycle without obvious decay. Furthermore, ZFO-450 delivers 1235, 1005, 865, 834, and 845 mA h g-1 at high current densities of 0.5, 2, 5, 10, and 20 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Thin triple-shelled hollow microsphere prepared at an optimum calcination temperature provides exceptional rate capability and outstanding rate retention due to (i) the formation of nanoparticles leading to thin shell with morphological integrity, (ii) the facile mass transfer by thin shell with mesoporous structure, and (iii) the void space with macroporous structure alleviating volume change occurring during cycling."
