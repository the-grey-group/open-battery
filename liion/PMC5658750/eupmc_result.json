    "Lithium ion batteries as a power source are dominating in portable electronics, penetrating the electric vehicle market, and on the verge of entering the utility market for grid-energy storage. Depending on the application, trade-offs among the various performance parameters-energy, power, cycle life, cost, safety, and environmental impact-are often needed, which are linked to severe materials chemistry challenges. The current lithium ion battery technology is based on insertion-reaction electrodes and organic liquid electrolytes. With an aim to increase the energy density or optimize the other performance parameters, new electrode materials based on both insertion reaction and dominantly conversion reaction along with solid electrolytes and lithium metal anode are being intensively pursued. This article presents an outlook on lithium ion technology by providing first the current status and then the progress and challenges with the ongoing approaches. In light of the formidable challenges with some of the approaches, the article finally points out practically viable near-term strategies."
