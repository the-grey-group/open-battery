    "In an effort to explore the use of organic high-performance lithium ion battery cathodes as an alternative to resolve the current bottleneck hampering the development of their inorganic counterparts, a rational strategy focusing on the optimal composition of covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) with carbon-based materials of varied dimensionalities is delineated. Two-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with a compatible structural conformation with the layered CTF is the most suitable scaffold for the tailored mesopores in the polymeric framework, providing outstanding energy storage ability. Through facile ionothermal synthesis and structure engineering, the obtained CTF-rGO composite possesses a high specific surface area of 1357.27 mÂ²/g, and when used as a lithium ion battery cathode it delivers a large capacity of 235 mAh/g in 80 cycles at 0.1 A/g along with a stable capacity of 127 mAh/g over 2500 cycles at 5 A/g. The composite with modified pore structure shows drastically improved performance compared to a pristine CTF, especially at large discharge currents. The CTF-rGO composite with excellent capacity, stability, and rate performance shows great promise as an emerging high-performance cathode that could revolutionize the conventional lithium-ion battery industry."
