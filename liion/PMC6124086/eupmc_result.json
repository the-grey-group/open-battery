    "Waterborne polyurethane (WPU) is first used as a carbon-coating source for micrometre-sized silicon. The remaining nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) heteroatoms during pyrolysis of the WPU interact with the surface oxide on the silicon (Si) particles via hydrogen bonding (Si-OH⋯N and Si-OH⋯O). The N and O atoms involved in the carbon network can interact with the lithium ions, which is conducive to lithium-ion insertion. A satisfactory performance of the Si@N, O-doped carbon (Si@CNO) anode is gained at 25 and 55°C. The Si@CNO anode shows stable cycling performance (capacity retention of 70.0% over 100 cycles at 25°C and 60.3% over 90 cycles at 55°C with a current density of 500 mA g-1) and a superior rate capacity of 864.1 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 (25°C). The improved electrochemical performance of the Si@CNO electrode is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity and structural stability."
