However, engineering and optimization of electrodes also play a crucial role, and the same electrode material can be designed to offer significantly improved batteries. In this work, Si&#x02013;Fe&#x02013;Mn nanomaterial alloy (Si/alloy) and graphite composite electrodes were densified at different calendering conditions of 3, 5, and 8&#x000a0;tons, and its influence on electrode porosity, electrolyte wettability, and long-term cycling was investigated. The active material loading was maintained very high (~2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) to implement electrode engineering close to commercial loading scales. The densification was optimized to balance between the electrode thickness and wettability to enable the best electrochemical properties of the Si/alloy anodes. In this case, engineering and optimizing the Si/alloy composite electrodes to 3&#x000a0;ton calendering (electrode densification from 0.39 to 0.48&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>) showed enhanced cycling stability with a high capacity retention of ~100% over 100 cycles. <graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="40820_2017_142_Figa_HTML" id="MO1"/>

Nickel&#x02013;metal hydride batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], nickel&#x02013;cadmium batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] are some of the different popular batteries commercially available in the market. In industry scale, high emphasis is given on the electrodes calendering and wettability optimization by means of pressure injection of electrolytes for consistent and stable batteries. Rather, in the laboratory scale research, the progress in battery technology most times is primarily inclined toward the development of novel electrode active materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], followed by binders, electrolytes, and enhancement additives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, to realize the true potential of an electrode material, it requires different levels of engineering design and optimization which should also be focused [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The same electrode material can be designed to achieve improved performances if parameters such as thickness, density, wettability, and porosity are controlled and optimized.</p><p id="Par6">In previous works, researchers have reported the effect of calendering on electrode wettability and electrochemical properties. van Bommel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] showed the improvement in the LiFePO<sub>4</sub> electrodes performance after calendering. Church et al. showed the changes in the pore structure and wettability after calendering of electrodes which can significantly impact the battery performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Kwade et al. discussed the impact of the compression by calendering on the interfacial structure, ion mechanics, and long-term electrochemical performance of LIBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Newman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] presented a reaction zone model to optimize the porosity and thickness of electrodes knowing its importance. Similarly, various studies and mathematical models have been developed to understand the physical phenomena and compute the variations in electrochemical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this work, the fabricated silicon alloy electrodes were calendered at 3, 5, and 8 tons pressure. The densified electrodes were investigated in terms of porosity, electrolyte wettability, and long-term cycling to provide insight on silicon alloy electrode design optimization for improved electrochemical performance. The anode electrodes were made of silicon (Si) alloyed with iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) as the active material. Si&#x02013;Fe&#x02013;Mn alloy material&#x02019;s (hereafter denoted as Si/alloy) significance is its easy synthesis using a very low-cost and low-temperature process that includes only mechanical milling and drying.

Furthermore, Mn combination can help to inoculate Fe, further improving the overall ductility of the metal alloy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].The objective of this research is to engineer the high loading Si/alloy and graphite composite electrodes by investigating the properties variations with calendering at different pressures and optimizing to balance between the electrode thickness and porosity&#x02013;wettability for improved electrochemical performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electrode Preparation and Calendering</title><p id="Par7">Si/alloy was prepared by using a low-cost and low-temperature mechanical ball milling process. A commercial high-energy ball mill (ZOZ GmbH, Simoloyer) was used for the mechanical alloying with elemental powders of Si (99.99%), Fe (99.9%), and Mn (99.9%) in the stoichiometric of 80:18:2&#x000a0;wt%, respectively, as the starting materials. The powders were loaded into the machine&#x02019;s hardened steel chamber with hardened steel balls of 4.7&#x000a0;mm diameter for milling. The milling cycle was characterized by a time interval of 45&#x000a0;s at 12&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (circumferential velocity), followed by 15&#x000a0;s at 8&#x000a0;m&#x000a0;s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 12&#x000a0;h and was fully carried out under super-high-purity argon atmosphere. The mass ratio of milling ball-to-powder materials was maintained as 20 to 1. The electrode slurry was prepared by first mixing 0.025&#x000a0;g of ketjen black (KB) and 1.35&#x000a0;g of polyamide-Imide (PAI) binder solution (14.8% binder and balance deionized water solution from Aekyung Chemical Co., LTD) in 2.6&#x000a0;g of deionized water for 4&#x000a0;h or more using magnetic stirrer at 100 RPM on a hot plate at 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. KB was used as a conductive filler additive, and PAI binder was chosen because of their high carboxylic groups which are known to form strong bonds with metal surfaces and maintain good electrical contacts between the electrode particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Active material was prepared by making a blend of the Si/alloy sample powder (40%) with MC20 (Mitsubishi Corp.&#x02014;Synthetic Graphite) and SFG6 graphite (TIMCAL TIMREX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>&#x02014;Synthetic Graphite) in the ratio of 42 and 18%, respectively. Active material blend (0.945&#x000a0;g) was then mixed in the KB-PAI binder solution slurry using ACE NISSEI homogenizer at 5000 RPM for 15&#x000a0;min. MC20 (0.93&#x000a0;g) and SFG6 (0.4&#x000a0;g) artificial graphite were added in sequence to the slurry solution with each step mixed at 5000 RPM for 10&#x000a0;min. The final contents were mixed using a spatula, and again a final mixing was performed using the ACE NISSEI homogenizer at 5000 RPM for 15&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min to get the homogenous electrode slurry. The order of materials for slurry making was decided based on the size and shape of the material components for homogeneous and good quality electrodes. The electrode preparation composition in total included Si/alloy (15.1&#x000a0;wt%), MC20 (53.1&#x000a0;wt%), SFG6 (22.8&#x000a0;wt%), PAI binder (8&#x000a0;wt%), and KB (1&#x000a0;wt%). The overall solid content used was around 40%. The resultant slurry was poured onto a Cu-foil, and doctor blade with thickness set to (0.15&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.01&#x000a0;mm) was run at 1.2 speed unit of CV-400 Rotech Lab Coater to get a final active material loading of ~2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.

The contact angles measured for the electrode samples were found to increase with calendering indicating the relative decrease in porosity and electrolyte wettability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The not-pressed electrodes showed a contact angle of 23.87&#x000b0;&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000b0; which was less than the contact angles of the pressed electrodes due to its high porosity.

The nitrogen gas adsorption isotherms are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c. The not-pressed electrodes have higher porosity and higher surface area which can adsorb more quantity of nitrogen gas, and hence, the isotherm adsorption level is greater for not-pressed electrodes. Likewise, the calendered electrodes showed reduced porosity and reduced surface area. The calendered electrodes showed relatively less amount of surface gas adsorption, and the adsorption isotherm curves were falling below the not-pressed electrode as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c. The results indicate that the not-pressed electrodes have a higher surface area of 10.05&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.

The pore size distribution comparison is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d. The not-pressed electrodes have an average adsorption pore width of 43.9&#x000a0;nm, while the calendered electrodes showed 76.4, 84.3, and 91.6&#x000a0;nm for 3- , 5- , and 8-ton pressed electrode, respectively (&#x000b1;10&#x000a0;nm approx.). From the BET results, the single point adsorption total pore volume of pores less than around 500&#x000a0;nm was found to be 0.011&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the not-pressed electrodes and little higher around 0.014&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup>&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (approx.) for the calendered electrodes, respectively. The small pore width and smaller pore volume for the not-pressed electrodes again indicate that they have a&#x000a0;large number of smaller pores and higher surface area compared to the pressed electrodes. However, the pressed electrodes were found to have relatively higher pore sizes and pore volumes compared to the not-pressed electrodes as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d. The results indicate the closing of a large number of smaller pores with calendering. The smaller pores are compressed and joined to form bigger structures showing good agreement with the decreasing trend in the surface area of the electrodes with increasing calendering pressure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Electrochemical Performance</title><p id="Par17">Densification of the electrodes showed stable cycle performance compared to the not-pressed electrodes. The coin cells made were galvanostatically charged&#x02013;discharged at 0.1C rate in the first formation cycle and tested at 0.5C for the next 100 cycles. The electrode loading for all the samples was high at around 2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>.</p><p id="Par18">In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, not-pressed electrode cell exhibited the highest delithiation charge capacity of 837.5&#x000a0;mAh&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 88.1%. The calendered electrode cells 3, 5, and 8 tons showed a reversible capacity of 782.7, 609.9, and 522.2&#x000a0;mAh&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the formation cycle with a Coulombic efficiency of 86.4, 84.3, and 80.5%, respectively. The decrease in charge capacity and Coulombic efficiency with increasing calendering is recognized to the decrease in surface and core active pores of the electrodes due to densification. Moreover, the electrochemical activity was also limited by the poor electrolyte wettability arising due to the reduced pores in the calendered electrodes. Similarly, the EIS measurements after the first cycle at 0.5C (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) show that the electrode impedance increases with increasing densification from not-pressed electrodes to 3- , 5- , and 8-ton pressed electrodes. Electrodes densification improves the particle-to-particle contact with pressing. However, the electrochemical performance is affected due to reduced electrolyte wettability and reduced electrochemical activity indicating the need for densification control and wettability optimization. The pressed electrodes with incomplete electrolyte fillings or poor wettability demand for increased electrolyte wetting time which again requires optimization. In this case, an overall waiting time of 30&#x000a0;min was applied for electrolyte wetting for all the pressed and the not-pressed electrodes during cell assembly.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>

</p><p id="Par19">The EIS and cycling capacity indicate that the 5- and 8-ton pressed electrodes with the poorest wettability would require much longer wetting time for reaching their true electrochemical potential capacity. In general, longer wetting time requirements would be stressful for the fast productivity of batteries and can only be considered to some degree upon optimization and balancing to desired electrochemical properties. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c demonstrates the stable cycle behavior of calendered electrodes compared to the not-pressed electrodes, but with a capacity tradeoff which was considerable of 3- and 5-ton pressed electrode cells. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c, the not-pressed electrode cell showed a delithiation charge capacity of 629.3&#x000a0;mAh&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the first cycle which faded to 552.6 mAh&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at 100th cycle at 0.5C cycling. The not-pressed Si/alloy electrodes showed high capacity at the first cycle and started to fade gradually for the next 20 cycles before stabilizing. The gradual fading for the initial cycles in not-pressed Si/alloy electrode cell is attributed to its relatively high lithium loss in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formations due to its high active surface area (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). It was also observed that during the cycle stabilizing stage, the capacity gradually increases for next following cycles which can be attributed to the increased lithiation into new active sites of the electrode as electrolyte wettability (i.e., electrolyte activating new open sites of the electrodes and also impregnating into deeper electrode core) gets improved with extended cycling. Similar cycling behavior was reported in the prior Si anode works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The calendered electrode cells showed a first cycle capacity of 574.2, 368.0, and 288.3&#x000a0;mAh&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the 3- , 5- , and 8-ton pressed electrodes, respectively. The capacity of the calendered electrode cells was lower because of the reduced active surface area (low surface area for pressed electrodes, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) and poor electrolyte wettability (increasing contact angle with pressing, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) limiting the overall electrochemical activity. However, the calendered electrode cells showed very stable cycle retention behavior compared to the not-pressed electrode cell due to improved particle-to-particle contact with pressing and improved particles connectivity. The capacity after 100 cycles for the 3- , 5- , and 8-ton pressed electrode cells was 606.1, 375.7, and 284.7&#x000a0;mAh&#x000a0;g<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively.</p><p id="Par20">For a better picturing of the stable electrochemical performance achieved with calendering, the delithiation capacity retention of the samples over 100 cycles (at 0.5C) is plotted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d. The not-pressed electrode cells showed a capacity retention of 87.8%, while the pressed electrodes showed capacity retentions almost close to 100% as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d. EIS was performed again, now after 100 cycles, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, which showed a similar trend in activity as observed in the first cycle EIS results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Electrochemical impedance measurements of the not-pressed, 3-ton pressed, 5-ton pressed, and 8-ton pressed electrodes after 100 cycles at 0.5C rate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40820_2017_142_Fig5_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par21">It should be noted that the same Si/alloy electrode material showed very different electrochemical behavior with different calendering. All the calendered electrode cells showed stable cycling behavior compared to the not-pressed electrode cell, but the overall capacity was lower with increasing calendering pressure due to reduced electrolyte wettability. Although the capacities are lowered, the stable cycle behavior with calendering would also make it easier to design high-density full cell batteries. In this case, 3-ton pressed Si/alloy electrode cell with a considerable capacity tradeoff showed high density and excellent cycle stability compared to the not-pressed Si/alloy electrode cell. Electrodes densification improves the particle-to-particle connections with pressing. However, the electrochemical performance is affected due to reduced electrolyte wettability and reduced electrochemical activity indicating the need for densification control and wettability optimization. Si/alloy electrodes with 5 and 8 tons pressed also showed stable cycling, but the capacities are very low to be considered. Therefore, optimization and balancing between the calendering pressure and electrolyte wettability property can help tune to the best electrochemical properties of the battery materials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par22">Si&#x02013;Fe&#x02013;Mn alloy electrodes with high loading of 2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;cm<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> were densified and investigated on porosity, wettability, and electrochemical properties for optimized performance compared to the not-pressed electrodes. Calendering is found to be influencing the long-term cycling and can be made beneficial with densification pressure and wettability optimization for the same electrode material (in this case 3-ton pressed electrodes). As a scientific rule of thumb, it should be considered that batteries are not always about just the right materials, but engineering and optimization can bring about a significant difference in the electrochemical properties. In short, electrode densification and wettability optimization balance are necessary to realize the true electrochemical potentials of the materials for batteries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the&#x000a0;material support and technical guidance from the MK Electronics Co., Ltd. in Korea, and financial support from Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, USA.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Doughty</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Roth</surname><given-names>EP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A general discussion of Li ion battery safety</article-title><source>Electrochem.
