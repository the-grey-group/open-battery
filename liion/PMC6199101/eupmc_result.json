    "A novel bismuth-carbon composite, in which bismuth nanoparticles were anchored in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Bi@NC), is proposed as anode for high volumetric energy density lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Bi@NC composite was synthesized via carbonization of Zn-containing zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF-8) and replacement of Zn with Bi, resulting in the N-doped carbon that was hierarchically porous and anchored with Bi nanoparticles. The matrix provides a highly electronic conductive network that facilitates the lithiation/delithiation of Bi. Additionally, it restrains aggregation of Bi nanoparticles and serves as a buffer layer to alleviate the mechanical strain of Bi nanoparticles upon Li insertion/extraction. With these contributions, Bi@NC exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate capacity compared to bare Bi nanoparticles or their simple composites with carbon. This study provides a new approach for fabricating high volumetric energy density LIBs."
