    "The paper reports a novel flexible full-cell lithium ion battery (LIB) through a simple plastic package method. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are synthesized by electrospinning technology and the subsequent carbonation process. The CNFs with three-dimensional interconnected fibrous nanostructure exhibit a stable reversible capacity of 412 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles in the half-cell testing. A full cell is assembled by using CNF anode and commercial LiCoO2 cathode, and it displays good flexibility and lighting LED ability. The aggregate thickness of the constructed full-cell LIB is approximately 500 μm, consisting of a CNFs/Cu film, a separator, a LiCoO2/Al film, electrolyte, and two polyvinyl chloride (PVC) films. The structure, morphology, and the electrochemical performances of electrospun CNFs and LiCoO2 electrodes are analyzed in details."
