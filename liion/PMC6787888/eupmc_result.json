    "Designing a composite separator that can withstand high temperature, deliver high capacity, and offer fast charge-discharge capability is imperative for developing a high-performance lithium-ion battery. Here, a series of ceramic nanoparticle-coated nanofiber membranes, including Al2O3/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), SiO2/PVDF, and Al2O3/SiO2/PVDF, were prepared by melt-electrospinning and magnetron sputtering deposition. Among all of these composite separators, Al2O3/SiO2/PVDF showed several advantages including excellent thermal stability (no dimensional shrinkage at temperature up to 130 °C and an onset degradation temperature of 445 °C) and superb electrolyte compatibility (340% electrolyte uptake). In addition, the β phase of the fibrous PVDF membrane as well as the presence of polar ceramic nanoparticles on the fiber surface can synergistically improve the ion conductivity to 2.055 mS/cm at room temperature, which is more than 8 times higher than that of the commercial polyethylene (PE) separator. Performance of these ceramic nanoparticle-coated separators in a lithium-ion battery demonstrated an improved discharge capacity of 161.5 mAh/g and more than 84.3% capacity retention rate after 100 cycles. The ceramic nanoparticle-coated PVDF separators also maintained 58.4% capacity at a high current density of 8C, which is better than the 49.8% capacity for the commercial PE separator. Therefore, the ceramic nanoparticle-coated PVDF membrane proves to be a promising separator for a high-power and more secure lithium-ion battery."
