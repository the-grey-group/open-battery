    "The intelligence to synchronously identify multiple spectral signatures in a lithium-ion battery electrode (LIB) would facilitate the usage of analytical technique for inline quality control and product development. Here, we present an analytical framework (AF) to automatically identify the existing spectral signatures in the hyperspectral Raman dataset of LIB electrodes. The AF is entirely automated and requires fewer or almost no human assistance. The end-to-end pipeline of AF own the following features; (i) intelligently pre-processing the hyperspectral Raman dataset to eliminate the cosmic noise and baseline, (ii) extract all the reliable spectral signatures from the hyperspectral dataset and assign the class labels, (iii) training a neural network (NN) on to the precisely \"labelled\" spectral signature, and finally, examined the interoperability/reusability of already trained NN on to the newly measured dataset taken from the same LIB specimen or completely different LIB specimen for inline real-time analytics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to quantitatively assess the capacity degradation of LIB via a capacity retention coefficient that can be calculated by comparing the LMO signatures extracted by the analytical framework (AF). The present approach is suited for real-time vibrational spectroscopy based industrial applications; multicomponent chemical reactions, chromatographic, spectroscopic mixtures, and environmental monitoring."
