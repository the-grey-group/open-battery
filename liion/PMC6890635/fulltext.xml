Here, we present an analytical framework (AF) to automatically identify the existing spectral signatures in the hyperspectral Raman dataset of LIB electrodes. The AF is entirely automated and requires fewer or almost no human assistance. The end-to-end pipeline of AF own the following features; (i) intelligently pre-processing the hyperspectral Raman dataset to eliminate the cosmic noise and baseline, (ii) extract all the reliable spectral signatures from the hyperspectral dataset and assign the class labels, (iii) training a neural network (NN) on to the precisely &#x0201c;labelled&#x0201d; spectral signature, and finally, examined the interoperability/reusability of already trained NN on to the newly measured dataset taken from the same LIB specimen or completely different LIB specimen for inline real-time analytics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to quantitatively assess the capacity degradation of LIB via a capacity retention coefficient that can be calculated by comparing the LMO signatures extracted by the analytical framework (AF). The present approach is suited for real-time vibrational spectroscopy based industrial applications; multicomponent chemical reactions, chromatographic, spectroscopic mixtures, and environmental monitoring.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Characterization and analytical techniques</kwd><kwd>Raman spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>Characterization and analytical techniques</kwd><kwd>Batteries</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Raman spectroscopy is a fast, non-destructive, and inexpensive spectroscopic tool to probe the molecular variations for a given specimen. The characteristic fingerprinting pattern of Raman spectrum provides much-needed access to the sample information at the molecular level. Besides, extending the singleton Raman spectrum analysis to the hyper-spectral domain either spatially or temporally, considerably, will help vibrational spectroscopy to be put to use, routinely, for the quality control (QA/QC) and product development applications. At present, hyperspectral Raman spectroscopy is mostly confined to the laboratory-scale measurement and analysis, and there are specific reasons for it not being used as the real-time quality-control analytical tool; (i) the presence of the cosmic noise and background signature in the hyperspectral dataset, (ii) inability to accurately identify the number of spectral signature in the hyperspectral dataset, and (iii) non-transferability of the existing analytical model from one set of hyperspectral measurement data to another set of newly hyperspectral measured dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Hyperspectral Raman imaging caters the ability to image multiple chemical signatures simultaneously, and the spatial information is collected in the X&#x02013;Y plane, and the spectral information is represented in the Z-direction, hyperspectral images are represented in the form of data cubes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The analysis of hyperspectral Raman dataset (multidimensional) is usually cumbersome, complicated, and multistep process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. With modern scientific characterization instrumentation and faster than ever data generation capabilities, there is an urgent need for an innovative machine learning (ML) based computational framework to automate the entire life cycle of hyperspectral analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The analytical model should be constructed with fewer or no human assistance. In addition, it is desired that the analytical model should be reusable, particularly on the newly measured dataset taken from the same specimen or completely different specimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Illustration of hyperspectral images (3D data cubes), the spatial information is collected in the X&#x02013;Y plane and the spectral information is represented in the Z-direction.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_54770_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e235"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">Recently, a number of ML techniques such as; principal component analysis (PCA), multiple curve resolution (MCR-ALS), independent component analysis (ICA), partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), voxel component analysis (VCA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NNF) have been applied for the identification/clustering of the significant spectral signatures from the test specimen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Among all, MCR-ALS analysis, also referred to as un-mixing, has been extensively utilized to resolve the multiple pure spectral signatures and of their respective concentration components in the hyperspectral datasets. Essentially, MCR-ALS is responsive to the small variation within the specimen, and it helps to associates this variation to the contribution of the respective components (spectral/concentration) that can be measured and analysed, either qualitatively or quantitatively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The indispensable condition for MCR-ALS analysis, to know beforehand, is the number of spectral signatures that are expected to be present in the hyperspectral datasets. An incorrect selection of the number of components can either lead to the inclusion of noise (i.e., overestimation) or loss of information (i.e., underestimation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In order to determine the appropriate number of components, to begin with, some methods such as; PCA, parallel analysis test, cross-validation, NMF-SO, and Kaiser criterion have been commonly used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, for any chosen dataset processed via MCR-ALS, the end-results using such methods are not consistent and resulting in a different number of spectral and concentration profiles. This inconsistency curtails the reliability of the MCR-ALS analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The peculiar challenge with MCR-ALS is to determine the total number of components that exist in the chosen dataset; more importantly, the reliability of the emerged components, whether they are not falsely true. Although, Hiromi <italic>et al</italic>. have purposed an innovative approach by tagging the component &#x0201c;reliable&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unreliable&#x0201d; based on the reproducibility of its appearance, regardless of the number of components chosen for analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the clustering of the concentration profiles, which is in unfolded spectral format, is quite vague and provides no visual confirmation to validate whether the rejected concentration profiles were really worth throwing out. Furthermore, the MCR-ALS analysis, encompass an analytical model that genuinely represents the characteristics of the test specimen, is a laborious process without having any reusability/transferability benefits, i.e., the newly established analytical model that is meant explicitly for a particular test specimen.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we propose an MCR-ALS based machine learning analytical framework (AF) to automate the entire pipeline of hyperspectral Raman analysis of lithium-ion battery (LIB) electrodes. The AF pipeline to make an analytical model involve; intelligently pre-processing the hyperspectral Raman data with fewer or no human assistance, accurately identifying the reliable spectral signature from the hyperspectral dataset and assign the class labels, training a neural network (NN) on to the accurately &#x0201c;labelled&#x0201d; spectral signature, and finally, testing the reusability of already trained NN to evaluate other test samples in real-time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for schematic diagram). We started with data pre-processing; airPLS and modified-PCA based algorithms to remove the background and cosmic noise from the raw dataset. Subsequently, determine the appropriate number of components (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>) with NMF automatic relevance determination (NMF-SO-ARD) and performed the cluster-aided MCR-ALS analysis by sequentially changing the number of expected component from n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 to <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, and tagging the component &#x0201c;reliable&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unreliable&#x0201d; based on the reproducibility of its appearance (see the image 2).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Machine learning based analytical framework (AF).

To cluster the reliable components, the concentration profiles were refolded to form images because, in contrast to the spectral format, the concentration profile provides better visual representation in pictographic format. Clustering of all the refolded concentration image dataset classifies concentration images into distinct clusters (collection of similar images). Clusters containing higher co-relation and reproducible images were stamped, as reliable clusters, and was retained for <italic>NN</italic> modelling. Each retained cluster was marked as a known class label. However, clusters having dissimilar images were rejected. Noting, by averaging all the concentration images and corresponding spectral profiles, within an individual retained cluster, provides a trusted singleton concentration image and spectrum profile.</p><p id="Par8">Lastly, we trained a neural network (TNN) using the retained spectral data set and spectrum class labels and accessed the accuracy of TNN against the same dataset that the TNN was derived. In addition, examined the interoperability of the TNN from one dataset to another dataset, extending the benefit of reusable TNN analytical model. Such a trained model is very efficient and reliable, considering the analysis can be completed in real-time. The present approach is suited for real-time vibrational spectroscopy based quality control (QA/QC) and product development tools for routine industrial applications such as; multicomponent chemical reactions, industrial processes, chromatographic, spectroscopic mixtures, and environmental monitoring, etc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Necessity of the Neural Network Model</title><p id="Par9">It is essential to illustrate what sorts of benefits will be served by the neural network model (NN). The limitations of routine MCR-ALS analysis are that it consumes considerable time before reaching an optimal solution of a given data-set, i.e., concentration maps and respective spectrum. Usually, the background subtraction, cosmic noise, MCR-ALS, and clustering required roughly forty to fifty minutes (on a personal computer- see details in the results section). In addition, the instrument-operator has no idea of the quality of the acquisition data being recorded during the characterization of the substrate. Considering, the analytics is often done in offline-mode that need separate plugins for background subtraction/cosmic noise/MCR-ALS. In a nutshell, MCR-ALS based analytical model is exclusive to the data-set it was created and cannot be reused to evaluate other similar specimens from the same batch or different specimen from the other batches, i.e., restricting the reusability/transferability of the MCR-ALS analytical model.</p><p id="Par10">The central idea of training a NN is to do the analytics in nearly real-time, for the purpose of curtailing the analytics turnaround time to a few seconds after the acquisition of the data to pre-processing to spatially mapping the concentration profiles. In an ideal scenario, it would be interesting if one could build an analytical model using MCR-ALS via any chosen specimen dataset. Afterword, MCR-ALS based analytical model is translated to create an NN model. Such a strategy will not only assist the instrument-operator to judge the quality of the acquisition data instantly but at the same time, the neural network-based model can be used to evaluate other analogous samples in real-time that would save time, cost and energy. Therefore, the necessity of NN becomes imminent, and the use of NN allows hyper-spectral Raman analytics even with the personal computer almost in real-time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Method</title><p id="Par11">Lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells were procured (Panasonic, Japan) and subsequently analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Alpha-300 confocal Raman microscope - WITec, GmbH) for hyperspectral Raman dataset.

Nevertheless, newly purposed PCA based despiking algorithm is very promising<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The PCA-despiking algorithm uses principal component analysis (PCA) that allows the number of variables in a multivariate data set to be reduced by retaining the crucial features and excluding the features whose contribution is either negligible or more like noise. The PCA-despiking algorithm is an ML technique that retains the essential features (i.e., scores) depending on the threshold (T) specified by the user<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Although the PCA-despiking algorithm works well on various kinds of dataset, nevertheless, it has a significant challenge; in particular, it fails to eliminate the spikes from the dataset in case the cosmic noise peak position for multiple spectra found to be identical. Conceding that, changing the threshold or using the algorithm in a loop does not facilitate to eliminate the cosmic noise (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>)).

Transposing the dataset, before calling the PCA-despiking algorithm, causes the randomness in the dataset, consequently removing all the spikes from the dataset.

Cluster-assisted MCR-ALS analysis helped to resolve the genuinely reliable spectral signatures (<italic>Z</italic><sub>Trusted</sub>) and concentration components (<italic>C</italic><sub>Trusted</sub>) in the hyperspectral Raman datasets. Clustering and labeling the RCIs in Raman dataset has not only provided the visual confirmation for validation of the MCR-ALS results, besides it has safeguarded throwing any vital information by choosing the CC (threshold) with better objectivity.

Firstly, the reference of extracted spectrums can be searched in the spectral database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Secondly, the number of extracted spectral signatures were few in numbers, smaller in size, as a consequence, training the neural network on cluster-assisted MCR-ALS labelled data was computationally inexpensive, faster and extendable on to the enormous dataset, makes it viable for inline analysis in real-time (Quantitate analysis of LIB electrodes is discussed in SI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

Nevertheless, the trace amount of components other than (C and LiMO<sub>2</sub>) were not consistent across all the three Raman dataset; it is because all three LIB samples contain different amount of degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S23</xref> shows the LMO and carbon spectrum, respectively, extracted using cluster-aided-MCR-ALS analysis from pristine, 500_In, and 500_Out LIB samples.

For pristine LIB sample, LMO spectra have a broad symmetric peak. The peak deconvolution shows the spectra are composed of four main peaks at 458, 524, 594, 635&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> can be assigned to Ni (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>), Co (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1g</italic></sub>), Mn (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>), and Mn (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1g</italic></sub>), respectively (SI Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">T6</xref>). The ration of Co (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1g</italic></sub>) and Mn (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) (retention coefficient) provide the state of health of battery; i.e., capacity retention.

ICP results show that the stoichiometric ratio in the LIB cell was Ni: Mn: Co (5.03: 3.0: 1.97). The Raman bands are due to the motion of oxygen atoms only, M-O stretching, and O-M-O bending modes.

Given the fact, Mn is electronically inactive, and it only takes part in electronic charge transfer with Ni cations. The cation mixing between nickel cobalt and lithium ions is feasible because ionic radii of Li<sup>+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, and Co<sup>2+</sup> are very close to each other 0.76, 0.69, and 0.65A, respectively. Cation mixing is responsible for the loss of capacity and reduces lithium diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In the present study, Raman active modes were found to be broader before charge/discharge cycling and become narrower after the LIB cycling. The chances of cation mixing in the early stage of charge/discharge are higher and drastically reduces as the charge/discharge cycle progresses because of the parasite reactions. As can be seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S24</xref>, the pristine LIB sample has a broader Raman peak compared to the 500_In and 500_Out LIB samples, notably, the Raman peak for 500_Out LIB sample has much narrow Raman peak than 500_In LIB sample, and it indicates that the interior and exterior electrode have experienced different amount of side reactions.</p><p id="Par41">In order to cross-validate the cluster-assisted MCR-ALS results, pristine, 500_In, and 500_out LIB Raman datasets (baseline and despiked dataset without normalization) were also processed using NMF-SO-ARD. The results show that the LMO signature extracted by NMF-SO-ARD has close resemblance with cluster-assisted MCR-ALS signature (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S25</xref>). The cluster-assisted MCR-ALS and NMF-SO-ARD results complement each other. It is recommended that the ration of Co (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1g</italic></sub>) and Mn (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) (retention coefficient) can provide the state of health of battery; i.e., capacity retention. Aiming the quantitative analysis of LIB electrodes, the elemental composition was evaluated for LMO and carbon. Each pixel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S26</xref>) contains the concentration of LMO and carbon. The number of pixels with an appropriate threshold is used as a metric for LMO and carbon quantification and was found to be within the range prescribed by the manufacturer of LIB electrodes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par42">We demonstrated that the analysis of hyperspectral Raman LIB electrodes was autonomous with almost no human assistance. Modified-PCA cleansed the cosmic noise efficiently, consequently, avoid the erroneous quantitative analysis. NMF-SO-ARD algorithm was well suited for automatically identifying the maximum number of components to be fitted for the LIB hyperspectral Raman dataset. For MCR-ALS analysis, the refolding of the concentration signatures into image brought the visual confirmation and safeguarded throwing any vital information; i.e., more intuitive. Unsupervised analytics &#x0201c;Cluster aided MCR-ALS&#x0201d; has helped to extract additional components that were not identified by univariate analysis. For inline real-time analytics, the results must be instant and that it was made possible by bridging the gap between the unsupervised and supervised analytics. Cluster aided MCR-ALS analysis helped to label the reliable signatures; as a result, the trained NN helped to predict the class labels with accuracy higher than 94.0%. For the LIB electrodes, the interoperability of the NN model was found to be consistent for its major constituents, such as C and LMO. The degradation of the LIB electrode can be quantified by monitoring the retention coefficient; the ratio between Co (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>1g</italic></sub>) and Mn (<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub>). The present analytical framework is not idiosyncratic and could be utilized for molecular variations containing spectroscopic dataset.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec24"><p>
