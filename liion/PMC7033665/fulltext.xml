properties, are currently the most promising candidates for solid-state
electrolytes in high-density lithium metal batteries. In contrast
to homogeneous polymer electrolytes, where ion transport is coupled
with polymer segmental dynamics and any attempt to improve conductivity

and declining fossil resources are overwhelming
challenges to humankind. Gaseous emissions from burning fossil fuels
and biomass are not only polluting the air over large modern cities
but are also creating alarming climate changes. Furthermore, it is
universally recognized that national vulnerabilities and social instabilities
can be created by a foreign dependence on fossil fuels. These concerns
lead to national initiatives to reconsider the use of alternative
energy sources such as solar radiation, wind, and waves. However,
the intermittence of these resources, since they are variable in time
and diffuse in space, requires high-efficiency energy storage systems.
If a future economy based on renewable energy sources is to become
reality, we will need to develop compact, safe, lightweight, high-capacity
rechargeable batteries with longer life/cycles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> At
present, the definitive route to increase the energy density of the
currently used, commercial available, Li ion battery (LIB) is the
incorporation of metallic lithium as the anode material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> For a given cathode material, metallic lithium maximizes the cell
voltage and has a specific anode capacity nearly ten times larger
than the currently used lithium-intercalating graphite anodes and
gives the maximum possible energy density of any anode material. Lithium
metal is the lightest (atomic mass of 7 g mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>),
one of the most reducing of metals (electrochemical potential of
&#x02212;3.04 V, measured against the standard hydrogen electrode)
and therefore holds the highest possible energy density for a negative
electrode.</p><p>Today, LIBs represent a multibillion-dollar industry
as the power
supply of cellular phones, tablets, laptops, and other hand-held electronic
devices. The currently used LIBs are composed of a liquid electrolyte,
which is a mixture of a lithium salt dissolved in an organic solvent,
sandwiched between two lithium-intercalating electrodes. Despite their
high ionic conductivity, liquid electrolytes are incompatible with
lithium metal with many safety issues. Presently the most difficult
challenge to the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) stems
from the uneven dendritic lithium electrodeposition on the negative
electrode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> Once nucleated, the growing dendrites have
at least two harmful consequences on battery operation. First, the
high surface area structures continuously react with the electrolyte
solvent to form solid electrolyte interface, consuming the electrolyte
and eventually causing premature battery failure. Second, dendrites
eventually short circuit the battery cell, as they create an electron-conductive
connection between the two electrodes. When a flammable electrolyte
is used, the dendrite-induced short is both a potential fire and explosion
hazard, leading to catastrophic battery failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup></p><p>After the theoretical prediction by Monroe and Newman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> that a mechanically robust electrolyte with a
shear modulus, <italic>G</italic>&#x02032;, of order of GPa would
mechanically suppress/block macroscopic dendrite formation and growth,
significant research efforts have focused on the development of solid-state
electrolytes, capable of eliminating dendrite formation while exhibiting
high ionic conductivity at room temperature. Solid-state electrolytes
fall mainly into two categories: inorganic ceramic electrolytes and
solid polymer electrolytes. Despite the fact that inorganic ceramics
exhibit satisfactory ionic conductivity and mechanical properties
that range from tens to hundreds of GPa, the lack of good adhesion
to Li electrodes (high-modulus materials often do not afford good
adhesion) significantly increases interfacial resistance during cycling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> Moreover, the electrochemical stability window
of ceramic electrolytes is very narrow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></p><p>The use of <italic>solid polymer electrolytes</italic> (SPEs)
represents
the ultimate solution due to the chemical stability of these materials
toward Li metal electrodes and their mechanical resistance to dendrite
growth. SPEs have a much better adhesion with electrodes than ceramics,
which, along with their good flexibility and scalable fabrication,
makes them favorable for battery manufacturing. The first observation
of ionic conductivity in complexes of lithium salts within linear
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) appeared in 1973 in <italic>Polymer</italic>, while its application in a battery cell was validated several years
later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> Since then, PEO has been the subject
of extensive studies owing to its ability to solvate a wide variety
of lithium salts; the ethylene oxide (EO) units have a strong affinity
for Li<sup>+</sup>, while their high chain flexibility and low glass
transition temperature promotes
fast ion transport (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a). It is widely accepted that ion conduction occurs in the
amorphous PEO phase and that ion diffusion is coupled with the PEO
dynamics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a,
top).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> At temperatures below the crystalline

&#x02248; 0.1 GPa (i.e., close to the required, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b), but ion conductivity at room temperature
is &#x003c3; &#x02248; 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup>&#x02212;10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup> S/cm, i.e., several orders of magnitude lower than what is required
for practical applications (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c). At temperatures <italic>T</italic> &#x0003e; <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>, the volume fraction of the amorphous, conductive
PEO
phase increases, Li<sup>+</sup> may transport throughout the whole
material (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a,
bottom), and the ionic conductivity can be as high as 10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> S/cm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c);
nevertheless, the melting of PEO crystals results in a modulus of
1&#x02013;10 MPa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b) and does not meet the criterion for reduced dendrite formation.
Unfortunately, in homogeneous polymer materials, any attempt to improve
conductivity via faster polymer motions results in a decrease in stiffness.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Schematic

with unentangled linear PEO homopolymer
electrolytes, ion diffusion occurs via the diffusion of the entire
PEO chain with the coordinated ion. With increasing PEO molecular
weight, entanglements start to occur between polymer chains; ion diffusion
is primarily mediated by segmental dynamics and Li<sup>+</sup> hopping
between adjacent ether oxygen atoms with the processes of breaking/forming
lithium&#x02013;oxygen (Li&#x02013;O) bonds (fluctuation driven diffusion).
Both mechanisms should occur in polymer systems with the relative
importance to depend on the molecular weight. As a result, at molecular
weight higher than 1&#x02013;2 kg/mol, the ionic conductivity is independent
of the PEO chain length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>d). It is important to point out that ion conductivity
depends strongly on the lithium salt concentration and has a nonmonotonic
behavior with lithium salt weight fraction (orange data, left axis
in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>e). This
is the result of two competing factors: on one hand, ionic conductivity
increases with lithium salt weight fraction as the free ion concentration
increases (light blue triangles, right axes in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>e), and on the other hand, due to the polymer&#x02013;ion
interactions, polymer dynamics decrease monotonically with increasing
salt concentration (dark blue squares, right axes in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>e); that tends to decrease
ion conductivity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>e).</p><p>In homogeneous polymer materials, like pure PEO-based
electrolytes,
ion motion/transport is coupled with segmental dynamics, and any attempt
to improve conductivity via faster polymer motions and/or melting
of crystals results in a decrease in stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> The &#x0201c;<italic>state-of-the-art</italic>&#x0201d; approach
to decouple these two antagonistic parameters is the generation of <italic>multi-phase nanostructured polymer electrolytes</italic>, where one
phase conducts ions (that needs to be soft/mobile phase needed for
fast ion motion), while the insulating glassy phase imparts the desired
mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> It is important to point out
that the addition of inorganic particles (hybrid polymer nanocomposite
electrolytes) offers a facile route to imparting needed materials
characteristics and has attracted considerable interest for the synthesis
of high-performance solid polymer electrolytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> However, despite the developments reported across a rich breadth
of polymer electrolytes systems, the best performing electrolytes
with G&#x02032; &#x0223c; GPa still have at least two orders of magnitude
lower ionic conductivities than what is required when their mechanical
properties are achieved.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Block Copolymer Electrolytes</title><p>A cost-effective, robust, and scalable way to generate complex
multidomain morphologies involves the self-assembly of block copolymers
(BCPs). The most basic version of a copolymer is a linear diblock
copolymer in which two chemically distinct chains, or blocks, are
linked end-to-end. The classic battle between entropy and enthalpy,
coupled with the geometric constraints on phase separation, cause
these materials to self-assemble into nanostructured morphologies
with length scales on the order of 5&#x02013;100 nm controlled by their
molecular characteristics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> These morphologies
include spheres arranged on a body-centered-cubic lattice, hexagonally
packed cylinders, bicontinuous gyroid networks, and stacked lamellae
depending on the composition of the block copolymer. At high enough
temperatures, entropy dominates, causing the two blocks to homogeneously
mix in a disordered phase; the nature of concentration fluctuations
in the disordered phase has been studied in considerable detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> The self-assembly behavior and resultant structure
is controlled by the volume fraction of one component <italic>f</italic> and the degree of segregation <italic>&#x003c7;N</italic>; &#x003c7;
is the Flory&#x02013;Huggins interaction parameter, which parametrizes
the thermodynamic compatibility between the two blocks, and <italic>N</italic> is the overall degree of polymerization. By tuning these
parameters appropriately, it is possible to obtain nanostructured
materials that combine the properties of the constituent blocks. This
has led researchers to use block copolymers as solid membranes for
selective transport of various species, typically with one transporting
block and one structural block.</p><p>Microsegregated PEO-based copolymer
electrolytes are currently
the most commonly studied nanostructured materials in all-polymer
nanostructured solid electrolytes. The earlier work on triblock copolymer
electrolytes was reported by Giles group in 1987. The triblock copolymer
was based on a styrene&#x02013;butadiene-styrene ABA triblock copolymer
having pendant, short PEO chains grafted onto the B block. The PEO
volume fraction in the polymer was controlled by varying either the
number of pendant groups or their molecular weight. In the absence
of any morphological and mechanical analysis, an ion conductivity
of &#x003c3; &#x02248; 10<sup>&#x02013;6</sup> S/cm was reported at room
temperature. In 1999, Mayes et al. proposed the use of comb diblock
copolymer, where the conducting block was composed of a poly(methacrylate)
backbone grafted with short PEO side chains (POEM). The idea was that
low-molecular weight PEO chains, grafted to synthetic backbone, would
have both fast dynamics and suppressed crystallization, favoring high
ionic conductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> By synthesizing a
variety of different POEM-based diblock copolymers, where the second
block was either poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA, <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> &#x02248; &#x02212;35 &#x000b0;C), poly(<italic>n</italic>-butyl methacrylate) (PnBMA, <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> &#x02248;
&#x02212;40 &#x000b0;C), or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> &#x02248; &#x02212;100 &#x000b0;C), they showed that the
highest conductivity is obtained when the POEM block is attached to
the soft, rubbery PLMA block, rather than to a glassy PMMA block.
SPEs with &#x003c3; &#x02248; 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> S/cm and <italic>G</italic>&#x02032; &#x02248; 0.5 MPa were reported for the POEM-<italic>b</italic>-PLMA block copolymer. On the basis of the same POEM conducting
block, Niitani et al. showed that the ionic conductivity and mechanical
strength vary in opposite way in polystyrene-<italic>b</italic>-poly(ethylene
glycol methacrylate)-<italic>b</italic>-polystyrene (PS-<italic>b</italic>-POEM-<italic>b</italic>-PS) comb triblock copolymers and depend
on the PEO weight fraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> At 30 &#x000b0;C,
when the PEO content exceeded 80%, an ionic conductivity of &#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup> S/cm was reported but with a very poor mechanical
strength as the soft, liquid-like, low molecular weight (<italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub>) PEO grafted chains dominated the average mechanical
response of the polymer electrolyte.</p><p>Balsara&#x02019;s group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> has extensively
studied the linear PS&#x02013;PEO diblock copolymer-based electrolytes.
Unexpectedly for what it was known for PEO-based electrolytes, in
PS-<italic>b</italic>-PEO electrolytes doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)
imide (LiTFSI) the ion conductivity was shown to increase with the
molecular weight of the PEO block; something that was recently verified
and predicted also theoretically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Balsara&#x02019;s
group explained this behavior in terms of the existence of a &#x0201c;dead
zone&#x0201d; for ion transport next to PS/PEO interface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> As the molecular weight of the PEO block increases, the
volume fraction of the &#x0201c;dead zone&#x0201d; decreases, and ion-conductivity
increases. A PS/PEO molar ratio around unity (i.e., in lamellar forming
electrolytes) provides the best balance between mechanical strength
and ionic conductivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a,b). At temperatures below the glass transition temperature
of the PS, that is, for <italic>T</italic> &#x0003c; 100 &#x000b0;C, <italic>G</italic>&#x02032; &#x02248; GPa (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b). Despite the good mechanical properties
of PS-<italic>b</italic>-PEO/LiTFSI electrolytes for a wide range
of temperatures, the ion conductivity at room temperature was &#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02013;7</sup> S/cm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a), that is, 3 orders of magnitude lower than what is required
for any practical application. Only at temperatures higher than &#x0223c;80
&#x000b0;C, that is, at temperatures above the melting of the PEO crystals,

Intragrain transport indicates conduction within grain boundaries,
while intergrain transport describes the connectivity of conducting
pathways across grain boundaries. For intragrain ion transport, domain

existing polymer chemistries in dual-ion conductors to enhance negative
charge delocalization. By doing so, both room-temperature conductivities
will be enhanced, and single-ion electrolytes with &#x003c3; &#x0003e; 10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup> S/cm could be efficiently incorporated in safe to
use lithium metal batteries.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Considering
the rapidly growing academic and industrial interests

batteries, it is reasonable to expect important breakthroughs in the
near future.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement" id="NOTES-d7e1340-autogenerated"><p>The authors declare no

of Patras, and he received his PhD in 2007 in polymer physics at the
University of Edinburgh. Until 2012, he was a postdoctoral research
associate at the Department of Material Science and Engineering at
the University of Michigan, working on the effect of macromolecular
architecture on the physical properties of polymers at surfaces and
interfaces. He was subsequently appointed as a Research Investigator
at the University of Michigan at the Center for Solar and Thermal
Energy Conversion, where his research was focused in addressing important
scientific challenges associated with the structure&#x02013;property
relations and correlations of the morphology of the device active
layer on the nanometer scale to the electrical and optical properties,
the charge photogeneration, and overall performance of these systems.
Since 2015 he is a Research Scientist at FORTH/IESL, where the objective
of his current research is to develop a fundamental understanding
of, and controlling via macromolecular engineering, the structure
and properties of nanostructured polymer materials that can be used
as solid electrolytes in lithium&#x02013;metal batteries and electrochromic
devices and as active layers in organic photovoltaics.</p></bio><bio id="BIO-d7e1322-autogenerated" rid="ath2"><p><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao9b04098_0002" position="float"/></p><p><bold>Christos
