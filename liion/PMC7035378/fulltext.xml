The electrochemical reaction during pre-doping formed a high-quality solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of silicon particles, which improved the charge and discharge cycle life with a small irreversible capacity. The surface composition of the pre-doped silicon particles was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), solid state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Pressurization promoted SEI growth and lithium binding with silicon to form Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> accompanied by the reductive reaction product of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> originated from electrolyte. The Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> was highly stable when the silicon anode was used in a full cell, thus resulting in a silicon anode with a long cycle life.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Batteries</kwd><kwd>Batteries</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Program for Creating STart-ups from Advanced Research and Technology Project, Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>MEXT | Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17938465</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishihara</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">An increasing number of intelligent devices, electric vehicles, and smart energy management systems are being used in all parts of society, and this growing market, especially in mobility and transportation, requires low-cost rechargeable batteries with high energy density. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are integral to these sophisticated devices; however, a serious drawback is that their energy density and&#x000a0; capacity density have not increased substantially<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. To solve this problem, silicon is an attractive anode material for the next generation of LIBs due to its high capacity of 3572&#x02009;mA&#x02009;h/g<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, which is approximately 10 times larger than that of graphite (372&#x02009;mA&#x02009;h/g).</p><p id="Par3">In the reaction mechanism of silicon during charging and discharging, the phase transition from the crystalline to amorphous state proceeds via the formation of a lithiated amorphous silicide in the initial discharging stage, followed by the formation of Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> in the deep discharging stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The high capacity of silicon causes a large expansion of electrode volume of up to 300&#x02013;400%, leading to the collapse of fine particle structures, and thus causing a dramatic decline in cycle performance. Various types of silicon nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and nanowires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> have shown longer cycling lives than micron-sized particles. The large surface area of nanostructured silicon should produce irreversible capacity caused by the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) passivation layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The SEI is important in silicon anodes because it allows the steady intercalation and desorption of lithium through the surface of the silicon particles. The SEI provides an inactivated and stabilized conductive pathway for lithium ions and not for electrons, and is even impenetrable to the electrolyte, which prevents further growth of the SEI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The formation of a stabilized SEI is still challenging because in conventional pre-doping methods, such as contact or electrochemical pre-doping, some of the lithium doping forms the SEI on the surface of silicon particles, and the rest of the lithium intercalates into the silicon particles. The intercalation causes the expansion and collapse of the silicon particles, continuously exposing new surfaces where the SEI is formed. This process destroys the silicon particles completely before the SEI layer is fully formed on their surfaces. Two main solutions to overcome these problems have been proposed. The first is using a binder, particularly durable binders, such as polyimides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> or styrene-butadiene rubber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> to maintain the size of silicon particles, but the method requires complicated pretreatments. The second is limiting the voltage range during battery operation to keep the volume change small, which improves the cycle life at the expense of the capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. These methods are unsuitable for industrial-scale production and remain at the laboratory scale.</p><p id="Par6">This study proposes a pre-doping process for silicon anodes, in which electrochemical pre-doping under pressure produces the SEI on the surface of silicon particles. The electrochemical reaction during pre-doping with electrolyte additives produces a high-quality SEI. Furthermore, the pressure relaxes the transformation strain of the silicon anode during pre-doping in a controlled manner that avoids the collapse of the silicon fine structure. We describe the properties and structure of a silicon anode electrochemically pre-doped under pressure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Electrochemical Pre-Doping under Pressure</title><p id="Par7">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the voltage vs. capacity profiles for the lithium pre-doping for silicon electrodes at current density of 0.11&#x02009;mA&#x02009;h/cm<sup>2</sup> (125&#x02009;mA&#x02009;h/g-Si) under pressure and without pressure. Electrochemical pre-doping without pressure terminated earlier with a notable voltage drop, leaving SEI formation unfinished. In contrast, pre-doping under pressure continued to a capacity of more than 1500&#x02009;A&#x02009;h/kg. This indicates that the internal resistance was reduced under pressure, which may relate to the change in electrode thickness in the cells. Actually, the thickness was decreased from 25&#x02009;&#x000b5;m to 18&#x02009;&#x000b5;m (28%) by applying the pressure of 50 kPa. Furthermore, pre-doping under pressure was expected to prevent the transformation and detachment of the electrode, improving the stability and charge and discharge cyclability.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Electrochemical profiles of the lithium ion pre-doping of silicon measured at a constant current value of 0.11&#x02009;mA/cm<sup>2</sup> under pressure and without pressure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2020_59913_Fig1_HTML" id="d29e387"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">The charge capacity of the pre-doped silicon anode in the first cycle shows the amount of intercalated and removable free lithium besides that consumed to form the SEI.

The cycle performance indicated the quality of the SEI formed in the pre-doping process.</p><p id="Par9">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the charge and discharge curves of full cells containing either a silicon anode electrochemically pre-doped under pressure or a pristine silicon anode with a LiNCM cathode for the first five cycles. The anode/cathode balance of the full cells was set to 1.0 assuming that apparent capacity of silicon is 2500&#x02009;mA&#x02009;h/g-Si by adjusting the amount of silicon on anode and that of LiNCM on cathode. The capacity of the cell containing a pre-doped silicon anode was consistent with the theoretical value for LiNCM of 150&#x02009;A&#x02009;h/kg. In contrast, the LiNCM electrode paired with a pristine silicon anode lost 15% of its capacity because the charging of silicon is not reversible. Moreover, the capacity decreased considerably as the number of cycles increased.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Charge and discharge curves of a silicon anode electrochemically pre-doped under pressure and a pristine silicon anode in LiNCM cathode cells for the first five cycles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2020_59913_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e403"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the capacity as a function of cycle number for full cells containing a LiNCM cathode and a silicon anode electrochemically pre-doped under pressure or without pressure. As a reference, the results for full cells containing a LiNCM cathode with contact pre-doped or pristine silicon anodes are shown. The pristine sample degraded within 20 cycles and formed neither an SEI nor pre-doped lithium in advance, meaning that lithium was consumed from the cathode leads to poor round Coulomb efficiency during the cycles. A linear decrease in capacity was observed, which may have been caused by the binder retaining the particle structure; however, the structure collapsed. In the contact pre-doped sample, the decrease in capacity was smaller than for the pristine sample due to the lithium pre-doping, and degradation was inevitable without SEI formation.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Cycle performance of full cells with a LiNCM cathode and various silicon anodes of electrochemically pre-doped under pressure, electrochemically pre-doped without pressure, contact pre-doped with lithium metal, and pristine silicon.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2020_59913_Fig3_HTML" id="d29e417"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">The sum of the lithium in anode and cathode is an important issue in this study. The amount of lithium in silicon anodes electrochemically pre-doped under pressure and without pressure, and contact pre-doped are 466, 140, and 1150&#x02009;mA&#x02009;h/g-Si, respectively, which are considerably lower than the theoretical capacity of silicon, 3572&#x02009;mA&#x02009;h/g-Si. Extra lithium provided from pre-doped silicon anode is partly consumed for SEI formation effective for long-term cycling stability. These results demonstrate that our pre-doping method produced superior electrochemical properties to overcome traditional barrier about poor round Coulomb efficiency of silicon anode during cycles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of Pre-Doped Silicon Particles</title><p id="Par12">We investigated how the pre-doping methods affected the structures and the electrochemical properties of silicon. The electrochemically pre-doped samples prepared under pressure and without pressure were analyzed by TEM to examine structural and surface composition changes as a function of the pressure.

We obtained pre-doped silicon samples with a Li/Si ratio of 2&#x02009;mol/mol by electrochemical pre-doping at a current value of 0.044&#x02009;mA/cm<sup>2</sup> without pressure. For both samples under pressure and without pressure, the capacity density of silicon anode pre-doping was set to 2.2&#x02009;mA&#x02009;h/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="Par13">Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows TEM images of the electrochemically pre-doped and pristine silicon particles. The pristine silicon had a clean surface and a thin amorphous edge (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c,f</xref>), whereas the surface composition of the pre-doped silicon samples depended on the pressure. After the silicon anode was pre-doped by discharging under pressure, the amorphous layer thickened because the crystallinity of the silicon was destroyed by lithium intercalation and SEI formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The samples electrochemically pre-doped under pressure had a sea-island structure of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> particles with their observed lattice planes and certain island structure distributed in the SEI layer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). There was no carbon in the pristine silicon anode, suggesting that the CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup> originated from the reductive reaction of the electrolyte.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>TEM images of silicon particles and SEI layer in silicon particles pre-doped under pressure (<bold>a</bold>,<bold>d</bold>,<bold>g</bold>), pre-doped without pressure (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>e</bold>,<bold>h</bold>), and pristine (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>f</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2020_59913_Fig4_HTML" id="d29e493"/></fig></p><p id="Par14">The TEM images of the sample electrochemically pre-doped without pressure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b,h</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>) show the lattice planes in the SEI layer converted from Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> to Li<sub>2</sub>O and silicon, and the SEI is much thinner than that formed under pressure. Because of insufficient doping in a limited doping time, no further reductive reaction of the electrolyte with Li<sub>2</sub>O to generate Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> occurred, and the silicon doping remained low with no further lithiation. Lattice fringes were also observed for the particles of the sample electrochemically pre-doped without pressure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>), which is consistent with the explanation.</p><p id="Par15">Solid state <sup>7</sup>Li MAS NMR experiments were performed on silicon anodes electrochemically pre-doped under pressure, without pressure, and contact pre-doped with the same doping level (2&#x02009;mol/mol). <sup>7</sup>Li NMR spectra of the all silicon samples showed three resonances at 0.3, 6.0, and 18.0 ppm from overlapping single peaks, which were separated and fitted based on literature data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

One explanation may be that the non-uniform contact of the silicon surface with lithium causes a heterogeneous lithium ion concentration distribution over the interface. In the sample that was electrochemically pre-doped without pressure, the amount of the Li<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Si complex with 0&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;<italic>x</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.3 was higher than in the contact sample (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the sample that was electrochemically pre-doped under pressure, the amount of the Li<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Si complex with 2.3&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;<italic>x</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3.8 was the highest, and that with 1.7&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;<italic>x</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.3 was the lowest (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The most significant difference of the sample electrochemically pre-doped under pressure compared with other samples is that the ratio of highly doped one (2.3&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;x&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3.8 Li<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Si) and that of slightly doped one (x&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 Li<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Si) are larger than that of moderately doped one (1.7&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;<italic>x</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.3 Li<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>Si), causing bipolarization of the doped products. These results suggest that several lithium ions bound to one silicon atom under pressure. To explain this result, the following two reactions between silicon and lithium with different stoichiometries were considered.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Pressure appeared to promote the reaction (2) to take place even in the theoretical capacity of reaction (1), increasing the amount of pre-doped lithium Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> to 60% (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Additionally, the ability of silicon to combine with several lithium ions during pre-doping explains why electrochemically pre-doping under pressure occurred continuously and approached the theoretical capacity in the charge curve (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The higher amount of doped lithium in the silicon under pressure than that without pressure was also demonstrated in the Si <italic>K</italic> absorption edge XAFS results (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">XRD was also used to explore the difference among the samples, electrochemically pre-doped under pressure, without pressure and pristine silicon anode. The XRD patterns were consistent with the evolution of the NMR peaks (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In the pristine silicon anode sample, in addition to the silicon peaks, only a crystalline phase signal for copper from the electrode foil was detected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for the sample that was electrochemically pre-doped without pressure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The lack of signals detected for doped lithium shows its negligible presence, and the difference between the two patterns was negligible. In contrast, the pattern for the sample electrochemically pre-doped under pressure contained several small signals for Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>XRD patterns of pre-doped silicon electrodes electrochemically pre-doped under pressure (<bold>a</bold>), electrochemically pre-doped without pressure (<bold>b</bold>), and pristine silicon anode (<bold>c</bold>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2020_59913_Fig6_HTML" id="d29e906"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">Finally, we assembled a full cell composed of an anode of silicon electrochemically pre-doped under pressure on stainless foil and a cathode of LiNCM, and performed five charge-discharge cycles.

We characterized the SEI layer formed on the silicon anodes by pre-doping, and revealed that pressure efficiently promoted SEI formation associated with Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> formation, and increased lithium insertion lead to one silicon particle tends to bind with more than two lithium particles. Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub> was stable in a full cell after five charge&#x02013;discharge cycles, suggesting that the silicon anode may have a long cycle life. The improved cycling performance and higher energy density was due to the formation of a complete SEI and high electrochemical lithium pre-doping under pressure. However, the electrochemical pre-doping under pressure requires further optimization to achieve precise control. The potential application of the method in combination with LIBs and other new batteries should also be further studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Materials and pre-doping</title><p id="Par20">The silicon particles were commercially available silicon fine powder (Si&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;99.5%, Silgrain e-Si 409, Elkem).
