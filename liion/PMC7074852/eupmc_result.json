    "Transition metal oxide is one of the most promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Generally, the electrochemical property of transition metal oxides can be improved by optimizing their element components and controlling their nano-architecture. Herein, we designed nonstoichiometric Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires for high performance lithium-ion storage. It is found that the specific capacity of Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires remain 880 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles, exhibiting much better electrochemical performance than CuCo2O4 and NiCo2O4. After experiencing a large current charge and discharge state, the discharge capacity of Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires recovers to 780 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, which is ca. 88% of the initial capacity. The high electrochemical performance of Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires is related to their better electronic conductivity and synergistic effect of metals. This work may provide a new strategy for the design of multicomponent transition metal oxides as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries."
