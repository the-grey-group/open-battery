Most of the nanodiscs had a diameter of approximately 500 nm and a thickness of approximately 50 nm. After further prolonged reaction times, secondary irregular nanodiscs gradually grew vertically into regular nanodiscs. These CuO nanostructures were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements. The possible growth mechanism of the interlaced disc CuO nanostructures is systematically discussed. The electrochemical performances of the CuO nanodisc electrodes were evaluated in detail using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the incorporation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes enables the enhanced reversible capacities and capacity retention of CuO nanodisc electrodes on cycling by offering more efficient electron transport paths.">

To develop sustainable and eco-friendly lithium ion batteries, we report reversible lithium ion storage properties of a naturally occurring and abundant organic compound purpurin, which is non-toxic and derived from the plant madder. The carbonyl/hydroxyl groups present in purpurin molecules act as redox centers and reacts electrochemically with Li-ions during the charge/discharge process. The mechanism of lithiation of purpurin is fully elucidated using NMR, UV and FTIR spectral studies. The formation of the most favored six membered binding core of lithium ion with carbonyl groups of purpurin and hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-4 positions respectively facilitated lithiation process, whereas hydroxyl group at C-2 position remains unaltered.">

As compared to the commercialized polypropylene (PP) separator, such composite separator presented improved electrolyte uptake, better interface stability and enhanced ionic conductivity. In addition, the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2)/graphite cell using this composite separator exhibited better rate capability and cycling retention than that for PP separator owing to its facile ion transport and excellent interfacial compatibility.

The morphology of the MnO2 prepared under acidic condition is urchin-like, while the one prepared under neutral condition is caddice-clew-like. The identical crystalline phase of MnO2 crystals is essential to evaluate the relationship between electrochemical performances and morphologies for lithium-ion battery application. In this study, urchin-like α-MnO2 crystals with compact structure have better electrochemical performance due to the higher specific capacity and lower impedance. We find that the relationship between electrochemical performance and morphology is different when MnO2 material used as electrochemical supercapacitor or as anode of lithium-ion battery.

Spatially resolved techniques, such as scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), are widely applied to address this challenge. However, battery materials are susceptible to electron beam damage, complicating the data interpretation. In this study, we demonstrate that, under electron beam irradiation, the surface and bulk of battery materials undergo chemical and structural evolution equivalent to that observed during charge-discharge cycling. In a lithiated NiO nanosheet, a Li2CO3-containing surface reaction layer (SRL) was gradually decomposed during electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) acquisition. For cycled LiNi(0.4)Mn(0.4)Co(0.18)Ti(0.02)O2 particles, repeated electron beam irradiation induced a phase transition from an layered structure to an rock-salt structure, which is attributed to the stoichiometric lithium and oxygen removal from 3a and 6c sites, respectively. Nevertheless, it is still feasible to preserve pristine chemical environments by minimizing electron beam damage, for example, using fast electron imaging and spectroscopy. Finally, the present study provides examples of electron beam damage on lithium-ion battery materials and suggests that special attention is necessary to prevent misinterpretation of experimental results.">

In order to facilitate TiO2(B)/C composites fabrication, the synthesized TiO2(B) particles were crushed into smaller sizes by ball milling. RESULTS: Ball mill treated TiO2(B) particles of less than 1.0 μm with a fraction of anatase phase, compared to as-synthesized TiO2(B) particles with about 24 μm in average particle size, showed a significant improvement in the electrochemical properties. They showed a much improved stability in the charge-discharge cycles and irreversibility. They maintained about 98% of the initial capacity during 50 cycles while as-synthesized sample before ball mill treatment showed a gradual decrease in the capacity with the cycles. The irreversibility of 12.4% of as-synthesized sample was also greatly improved to 7% after ball milling treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate ball mill treatment can be an economical way to improve electrochemical properties of TiO2(B) anode materials for lithium ion battery application.">

A continuous 3D conductive network formed by graphene can effectively improve the electron and ion transportation of the electrode materials, so the addition of graphene can greatly enhance lithium ion battery's properties and provide better chemical stability, higher electrical conductivity and higher capacity.

After etching and subsequent carbon coating, the treated Ge nanostructures provide good electrical conductivity and are resistant to gradual deterioration, resulting in superior electrochemical performance as anode materials for LIBs, with a charge capacity retention of 96% after 100 cycles and a high specific capacity of 1360 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and a high-rate capability with reversible capacities of 1080 and 850 mA h g(-1) at the rates of 5 and 10 C, respectively.

However, the conventional organic electrodes remain problematic because of their structural instability, slow ion-diffusion dynamics, and poor electrical conductivity. Here, we report on the development of a redox-active, crystalline, mesoporous covalent organic framework (COF) on carbon nanotubes for use as electrodes; the electrode stability is enhanced by the covalent network, the ion transport is facilitated by the open meso-channels, and the electron conductivity is boosted by the carbon nanotube wires. These effects work synergistically for the storage of energy and provide lithium-ion batteries with high efficiency, robust cycle stability, and high rate capability. Our results suggest that redox-active COFs on conducting carbons could serve as a unique platform for energy storage and may facilitate the design of new organic electrodes for high-performance and environmentally benign battery devices.">

The layered morphology and polymer to ceramic transformation on MoS2 surfaces was confirmed by use of electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. Tested as thick film electrode in a Li-ion battery half-cell, SiCN-MoS2 showed the classical three-stage reaction with improved cycling stability and capacity retention than neat MoS2. Contribution of conversion reaction of Li/MoS2 system on overall capacity was marginally affected by the presence of SiCN while Li-irreversibility arising from electrolyte decomposition was greatly suppressed. This is understood as one of the reasons for decreased first cycle loss and increased capacity retention. SiCN-MoS2 in the form of self-supporting paper electrode (at 6 mg·cm(-2)) exhibited even better performance, regaining initial charge capacity of approximately 530 mAh·g(-1) when the current density returned to 100 mA·g(-1) after continuous cycling at 2400 mA·g(-1) (192 mAh·g(-1)). MoS2 cycled electrode showed mud-cracks and film delamination whereas SiCN-MoS2 electrodes were intact and covered with a uniform solid electrolyte interphase coating. Taken together, our results suggest that molecular level interfacing with precursor-derived SiCN is an effective strategy for suppressing the metal-sulfide/electrolyte degradation reaction at low discharge potentials.">

Introducing other cheaper elements into the germanium-based material is an efficient way to dilute the high price, but normally sacrifice its electrochemical performance. By the combination of nanostructure design and cheap element (calcium) introduction, urchin-like Ca2Ge7O16 hierarchical hollow microspheres have been successfully developed in order to reduce the price and maintain the good electrochemical properties of germanium-based material. The electrochemical test results in different electrolytes show that ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate (3/4/3 by volume) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate additive is the most suitable solvent for the electrolyte. From the electrochemical evaluation, the as-synthesized Ca2Ge7O16 hollow microspheres exhibit high reversible specific capacity of up to 804.6 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles and remarkable rate capability of 341.3 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 4 A g(-1).

Here we report direct graphene growth over silicon nanoparticles without silicon carbide formation. The graphene layers anchored onto the silicon surface accommodate the volume expansion of silicon via a sliding process between adjacent graphene layers. When paired with a commercial lithium cobalt oxide cathode, the silicon carbide-free graphene coating allows the full cell to reach volumetric energy densities of 972 and 700 Wh l(-1) at first and 200th cycle, respectively, 1.8 and 1.5 times higher than those of current commercial lithium-ion batteries.

L-ascorbyl acid is used to effectively reduce the SnO2 nanoparticles/graphene oxide colloidal solution and form the 3D conductive graphene networks. The annealing treatment contributes to the formation of the Sn-O-C bonds between the SnO2 nanoparticles and the reduced graphene sheets, which improves the electrochemical performance of the foams. The ASGF has features of typical aerogels: low density (about 19 mg cm(-3)), smooth surface and porous structure. The ASGF anodes exhibit good specific capacity, excellent cycling stability and superior rate capability. The first reversible specific capacity is as high as 984.2 mAh g(-1) at a specific current of 200 mA g(-1). Even at the high specific current of 1000 mA g(-1) after 150 cycles, the reversible specific capacity of ASGF is still as high as 533.7 mAh g(-1), about twice as much as that of SGF (297.6 mAh g(-1)) after the same test. This synthesis method can be scaled up to prepare other metal oxides particles/ graphene sheet foams for high performance lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and catalysts, etc.">

The battery exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 3063 mAh/g and an initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82.9 %. With a current density of 300 mA/g, its reversible capacity can remains 1060 mAh/g after 350 cycles, corresponding to a CE ≥ 99.8 %. It is believed that the Cu2+1O coating enhances the electrical conductivity, and the elasticity of Cu2+1O further helps buffer the volume changes during lithiation/delithiation processes. Experiment results indicate that the electrode maintained a highly integrated structure after 100 cycles and it is in favour of the formation of stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the Si surface to keep the extremely high CE during long charge and discharge cycles.">

Coating a conformal, conductive and optimal ultrathin film on cathode particles has significantly increased the capacity retention and cycle life as demonstrated in our previous work. In this work, we have unearthed the synergetic effect of electrochemically active iron oxide films coating and partial doping of iron on LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) particles. The ionic Fe penetrates into the lattice structure of LMNO during the ALD process. After the structural defects were saturated, the iron started participating in formation of ultrathin oxide films on LMNO particle surface. Owing to the conductive nature of iron oxide films, with an optimal film thickness of ~0.6 nm, the initial capacity improved by ~25% at room temperature and by ~26% at an elevated temperature of 55 °C at a 1C cycling rate. The synergy of doping of LMNO with iron combined with the conductive and protective nature of the optimal iron oxide film led to a high capacity retention (~93% at room temperature and ~91% at 55 °C) even after 1,000 cycles at a 1C cycling rate.">

It was found that the incorporation of In into SnO2 reduces the charge transfer resistance during cycling, prolonging life. It is also hypothesized that the increased conductivity allows the tin oxide conversion and alloying reactions to both be reversible, leading to very high capacity near 1200 mAh/g.

A long-standing obstacle has been metal-ion dissolution at high voltages. The LiPF6 salt in conventional electrolytes is chemically unstable, which accelerates transition metal dissolution of the electrode material, yet beneficially suppresses oxidative dissolution of the aluminium current collector; replacing LiPF6 with more stable lithium salts may diminish transition metal dissolution but unfortunately encounters severe aluminium oxidation. Here we report an electrolyte design that can solve this dilemma. By mixing a stable lithium salt LiN(SO2F)2 with dimethyl carbonate solvent at extremely high concentrations, we obtain an unusual liquid showing a three-dimensional network of anions and solvent molecules that coordinate strongly to Li(+) ions. This simple formulation of superconcentrated LiN(SO2F)2/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte inhibits the dissolution of both aluminium and transition metal at around 5 V, and realizes a high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/graphite battery that exhibits excellent cycling durability, high rate capability and enhanced safety.">

According to the calculated results based on the XRD data, the as-milled 20 h sample has the smallest avergae crystalline size. It is supposed that the flexible ribbon structure allows for accommodation of intrinsic damage, which significantly improves the fracture toughness of the composite. The charge and discharge tests of the as-milled 20 h sample have been performed with reference to Li(+)/Li at a current density of 400 mA g(-1) in the voltage from 1.5 to 0.03 V (vs Li/Li(+)) and the result shows that the initial capacity is ∼1400 mA h g(-1), with a retention of ∼1100 mA h g(-1) reversible capacity after 50 cycles, which is possible serving as the promising anode material for the lithium ion battery application.">

In the present study a cellulose nanofiber/PET nonwoven composite separator is successfully fabricated, using a wet-laid nonwoven (papermaking) process, which can attain optimal properties in wettability, mechanical strength, thermal resistance, and electrochemical performance simultaneously. The PET nonwoven material, which is fabricated from ultrafine PET fibers by a wet-laid process, is a mechanical support layer. The porous structure of the composite separator was created by cellulose nanofibers coating the PET in a papermaking process. Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), which are an eco-friendly sustainable resource, have been drawing considerable attention due to their astounding properties, such as: incredible specific surface area, thermal and chemical stability, high mechanical strength and hydrophilicity. The results show that the CNF separator exhibits higher porosity (70%) than a PP (polypropylene) separator (40%). The CNF separator can also be wetted by electrolyte in a few seconds while a PP separator cannot be entirely wetted after 1 min. The CNF separator has an electrolyte uptake of 250%, while a PP separator has only 65%. Another notable finding is that the CNF separator has almost no shrinkage when exposed to 180 °C for 1 h, whereas a PP separator shrinks by more than 50%. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) shows that the CNF separator has a higher melting point than a PP separator. These findings all indicate that the CNF 29 separator will be more favorable than stretch film for use in Lithium-ion batteries.">

Quantitative measurement of key structural parameters of lithium-ion battery electrode microstructures will enable optimization as well as motivate systematic numerical studies for the improvement of battery performance. With the rapid development of 3-D imaging techniques, quantitative assessment of 3-D microstructures from 2-D image sections by stereological methods appears outmoded; however, in spite of the proliferation of tomographic imaging techniques, it remains significantly easier to obtain two-dimensional (2-D) data sets. In this study, stereological prediction and three-dimensional (3-D) analysis techniques for quantitative assessment of key geometric parameters for characterizing battery electrode microstructures are examined and compared. Lithium-ion battery electrodes were imaged using synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy. For each electrode sample investigated, stereological analysis was performed on reconstructed 2-D image sections generated from tomographic imaging, whereas direct 3-D analysis was performed on reconstructed image volumes. The analysis showed that geometric parameter estimation using 2-D image sections is bound to be associated with ambiguity and that volume-based 3-D characterization of nonconvex, irregular and interconnected particles can be used to more accurately quantify spatially-dependent parameters, such as tortuosity and pore-phase connectivity.">

Understanding the structure, wetting and mobility at nano-confined interfaces is important for improving the efficiency and lifetime of electrochemical devices. Here we use a Surface Forces Apparatus to quantify the initial wetting of nanometre-confined graphene, gold and mica surfaces by Li-ion battery electrolytes. Our results indicate preferential wetting of confined graphene in comparison with gold or mica surfaces because of specific interactions of the electrolyte with the graphene surface. In addition, wetting of a confined pore proceeds via a profoundly different mechanism compared with wetting of a macroscopic surface. We further reveal the existence of molecularly layered structures of the confined electrolyte. Nanoscopic confinement of less than 4-5 nm and the presence of water decrease the mobility of the electrolyte. These results suggest a lower limit for the pore diameter in nanostructured electrodes.">

Here we demonstrate operando tomography of weakly attenuating electrodes during electrochemical (de)lithiation. We use propagation-based phase contrast tomography to facilitate the differentiation between weakly attenuating materials and apply digital volume correlation to capture the dynamics of the electrodes during operation. After validating that we can quantify the local electrochemical activity and microstructural changes throughout graphite electrodes, we apply our technique to graphite-silicon composite electrodes. We show that microstructural changes that occur during (de)lithiation of a pure graphite electrode are of the same order of magnitude as spatial inhomogeneities within it, while strain in composite electrodes is locally pronounced and introduces significant microstructural changes.">

Rational designing nanosized metal oxide/carbon composite architectures has been proven to be an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance. In this work, the (Co,Mn)3O4 spinel was synthesized and anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets using a facile and single hydrothermal step with H2O2 as additive, no further additional calcination required. Analysis showed that this method gives a mixed spinel, i.e. (Co,Mn)3O4, having 2+ and 3+ Co and Mn ions in both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of the spinel structure, with a nanocubic morphology roughly 20 nm in size. The nanocubes are bound onto the rGO nanosheet uniformly in a single hydrothermal process, then the as-prepared (Co,Mn)3O4/rGO composite was characterized as the anode materials for Li-ion battery (LIB). It can deliver 1130.6 mAh g-1 at current density of 100 mA g-1 with 98% of coulombic efficiency after 140 cycles. At 1000 mA g-1, the capacity can still maintain 750 mAh g-1, demonstrating excellent rate capabilities.

Unique multicore-shell (MCS) structure of the electrospun composite fibers was obtained, which resulted from electrospinning a phase-separated polymer composite solution. Multiple PI core fibrils with high molecular orientation were well-embedded across the cross-section and contributed remarkable thermal stabilities to the MCS membrane. Thus, no outbreaks were found in its dimension and ionic resistance up to 200 and 250 °C, respectively. Moreover, the MCS membrane (at ~200 °C), as a lithium ion battery (LIB) separator, showed superior thermal and electrochemical stabilities compared with a widely used commercial separator (~120 °C). The average capacity decay rate of LIB for 500 cycles was calculated to be approximately 0.030 mAh/g/cycle. This value demonstrated exceptional long-term stability compared with commercial LIBs and with two other types (single core-shell and co-electrospun separators incorporating with functionalized TiO2) of PI/PVdF composite separators. The proper architecture and synergy effects of multiple PI nanofibrils as a thermally stable polymer in the PVdF shell as electrolyte compatible polymers are responsible for the superior thermal performance and long-term stability of the LIB.">

However, the pervasively low capacity is casting shadow on desirable electrochemical behaviors and obscuring their practical applications. In this work, we reported a unique template-assisted and two-step atomic layer deposition (ALD) method to achieve TiO2@Fe2O3 core-shell nanotube arrays with hollow interior and double-wall coating. The as-prepared architecture combines both merits of the high specific capacity of Fe2O3 and structural stability of TiO2 backbone. Owing to the nanotubular structural advantages integrating facile strain relaxation as well as rapid ion and electron transport, the TiO2@Fe2O3 nanotube arrays with a high mass loading of Fe2O3 attained desirable capacity of ~520 mA h g-1, exhibiting both good rate capability under uprated current density of 10 A g-1 and especially enhanced cycle stability (~450 mA h g-1 after 600 cycles), outclassing most reported TiO2@metal oxide composites. The results not only provide a new avenue for hybrid core-shell nanotube formation, but also offer an insight for rational design of advanced electrode materials for LIBs.">

Despite various experimental evidences indicating that lithium ion forms a rigid and stable solvation sheath through electrostatic interactions with polar carbonates, both the lithium solvation structure and more importantly fluctuation dynamics and functional role of carbonate solvent molecules have not been fully elucidated yet with femtosecond vibrational spectroscopic methods. Here we investigate the ultrafast carbonate solvent exchange dynamics around lithium ions in electrolyte solutions with coherent two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and find that the time constants of the formation and dissociation of lithium-ion···carbonate complex in solvation sheaths are on a picosecond timescale.

Thin triple-shelled ZnFe2O4 hollow microspheres calcined at 450 °C (ZFO-450) delivers a high reversible capacity of 932 mA h g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1 even at the 200th cycle without obvious decay.

Experimental results also demonstrated that the anode thickness significantly influence the specific capacity of the battery. Meanwhile, the ECF anode retained a high rate performance and an excellent cycling performance approaching 100% of its initial capacity over 300 cycles at 0.1 A/g. In addition, no binders, carbon additives or current collectors are added to the ECF based cells that will increase the total weight of devices. The high electrochemical performance was mainly attributed to the combined favorable hierarchical structures which can facilitate the Li+ accessibility and also enable the fast diffusion of electron into the electrode during the charge and discharge process. The synthesis process used to make this elastic carbon foam is readily scalable to industrial applications in energy storage devices such as li-ion battery and supercapacitor.">

A series of experiments were conducted on an electric heating and testing apparatus. The experimental results indicate that 6 W is the critical heating power for 40% SOC. With a 20 W constant heating rate, the thermal runaway initial temperature of the lithium-ion battery decreases with the increasing SOC. The final thermal runaway temperature increases with the SOC when the SOC is lower than 80%. However, a contrary conclusion was obtained when the SOC was higher than 80%. Significant mass loss, accompanied by an intense exothermic reaction, took place under a higher SOC. The critical charging current, beyond which the thermal runaway occurs, was found to be 2.6 A. The thermal runaway initial temperature decreases with the increasing charging current, while the intensity of the exothermic reaction varies inversely. Mass ejection of gas and electrolytes exists during thermal runaway when the charging current is higher than 10.4 A, below which only a large amount of gas is released. The thermal runaway initial temperature of discharging is higher than that of non-discharging.">

The measured reversible lithium ion capacities of CNT-based anodes are considerably improved compared to the conventional graphite-based anodes. Additionally, the opened structure and enriched chirality of CNTs can help to improve the capacity and electrical transport in CNT-based LIBs. Therefore, the modification of CNTs and design of CNT structure provide strategies for improving the performance of CNT-based anodes. CNTs could also be assembled into free-standing electrodes without any binder or current collector, which will lead to increased specific energy density for the overall battery design. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of lithium ion intercalation and diffusion in CNTs, and the influence of different structures and morphologies on their performance as anode materials for LIBs.">

Modeling every single cell in detail would be costly. However, computational accuracy could be lost if the module is modeled by using a simple bulk material or rigid body. To solve this critical engineering problem, a general method to establish a computational homogenized model for the cylindrical battery module is proposed. A single battery cell model is developed and validated through radial compression and bending experiments. To analyze the homogenized mechanical properties of the module, a representative unit cell (RUC) is extracted with the periodic boundary condition applied on it. An elastic-plastic constitutive model is established to describe the computational homogenized model for the module. Two typical packing modes, i.e., cubic dense packing and hexagonal packing for the homogenized equivalent battery module (EBM) model, are targeted for validation compression tests, as well as the models with detailed single cell description. Further, the homogenized EBM model is confirmed to agree reasonably well with the detailed battery module (DBM) model for different packing modes with a length scale of up to 15 × 15 cells and 12% deformation where the short circuit takes place. The suggested homogenized model for battery module makes way for battery module and pack safety evaluation for full-size electric vehicle crashworthiness analysis.">

A redox process involves transfer of electrons between two species. For example, in a lithium-ion battery, current is generated when conduction electrons from the lithium anode are transferred to the redox orbitals of the cathode material. The ability to visualize or image the redox orbitals and how these orbitals evolve under lithiation and delithiation processes is thus of great fundamental and practical interest for understanding the workings of battery materials. We show that inelastic scattering spectroscopy using high-energy x-ray photons (Compton scattering) can yield faithful momentum space images of the redox orbitals by considering lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4 or LFP) as an exemplar cathode battery material. Our analysis reveals a new link between voltage and the localization of transition metal 3d orbitals and provides insight into the puzzling mechanism of potential shift and how it is connected to the modification of the bond between the transition metal and oxygen atoms. Our study thus opens a novel spectroscopic pathway for improving the performance of battery materials.">

Although the emission of toxic gases can be a larger threat than the heat, the knowledge of such emissions is limited. This paper presents quantitative measurements of heat release and fluoride gas emissions during battery fires for seven different types of commercial lithium-ion batteries. The results have been validated using two independent measurement techniques and show that large amounts of hydrogen fluoride (HF) may be generated, ranging between 20 and 200 mg/Wh of nominal battery energy capacity. In addition, 15-22 mg/Wh of another potentially toxic gas, phosphoryl fluoride (POF3), was measured in some of the fire tests. Gas emissions when using water mist as extinguishing agent were also investigated. Fluoride gas emission can pose a serious toxic threat and the results are crucial findings for risk assessment and management, especially for large Li-ion battery packs.">

Taking advantage of meso-porosity and large available quantity, we apply rice husk-originating Si to lithium ion battery anodes in a composite form with commercial graphite. By varying the mass ratio between these two components, trade-off relation between specific capacity and cycle life was observed. A controllable pre-lithiation scheme was adopted to increase the initial Coulombic efficiency and energy density. The series of electrochemical results suggest that rice husk-originating Si-graphite composites are promising candidates for high capacity lithium ion battery anodes, with the prominent advantages in battery performance and scalability.">

Herein, LVP particles are anchored onto the surface of carbon nanofiber, and with this growing process, the size of LVP particles as well as the thickness of carbon nanofiber can be regulated together. The morphological features of this composite structure enable not only direct contact between electrolytes and LVP particles that can enhance lithium ion diffusivity, but also fast electron transport through 1D carbon network along nanofibers simultaneously. Finally, it is demonstrated that this unique structure is an ideal one to realize high electron transport and ion diffusivity together, which are essential for enhancing the electrochemical performances of electrode materials.">

The electrochemical performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge measurements.

Varied substituents on the vicinal diamine structure were examined towards an optimized reaction center in terms of electron density and steric hindrance. Possible interaction mechanisms of the diamine derivatives with ferric species and the correlation between the aspect ratio and electrochemical performance are discussed. Intermediate-sized α-Fe2O3 nanorods with length/aspect ratios of ≈240 nm/≈2.6 and ≈280 nm/≈3.0 were found to have excellent electrochemical characteristics with reversible discharge capacities of 1086 and 1072 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C after 50 cycles.">

        <span class="abst" title="Through a facile sodium sulfide (Na2S)-assisted hydrothermal treatment, clean and nondefective surfaces are constructed on micrometer-sized Li4Ti5O12 particles. The remarkable improvement of surface quality shows a higher first cycle Coulombic efficiency (≈95%), a significantly enhanced cycling performance, and a better rate capability in electrochemical measurements. A combined study of Raman spectroscopy and inductive coupled plasma emission spectroscopy reveals that the evolution of Li4Ti5O12 surface in a water-based hydrothermal environment is a hydrolysis-recrystallization process, which can introduce a new phase of anatase-TiO2. While, with a small amount of Na2S (0.004 mol L-1 at least), the spinel-Li4Ti5O12 phase is maintained without a second phase. During this process, the alkaline environment created by Na2S and the surface adsorption of the sulfur-containing group (HS- or S2-) can suppress the recrystallization of anatase-TiO2 and renew the particle surfaces. This finding gives a better understanding of the surface-property relationship on Li4Ti5O12 and guidance on preparation and modification of electrode material other than coating or doping.">

The electrochemical measurements showed that the SiC-based electrode delivered a stable reversible capacity of 254.5 mAh g-1 after 250 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. It is interesting that a high discharge capacity of 540.1 mAh g-1 was achieved after 500 cycles at an even higher current density of 0.3 A g-1, which is higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite. The results imply that SiC nanomaterials are potential anode candidate for LIBs with high stability due to their high structure stability as supported with the transmission electron microscopy images.">

These incidents are reminders that safety is a prerequisite for batteries, and serious issues need to be resolved before the future application of high-energy battery systems. This Review aims to summarize the fundamentals of the origins of LIB safety issues and highlight recent key progress in materials design to improve LIB safety.

The remaining nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) heteroatoms during pyrolysis of the WPU interact with the surface oxide on the silicon (Si) particles via hydrogen bonding (Si-OH⋯N and Si-OH⋯O). The N and O atoms involved in the carbon network can interact with the lithium ions, which is conducive to lithium-ion insertion. A satisfactory performance of the Si@N, O-doped carbon (Si@CNO) anode is gained at 25 and 55°C. The Si@CNO anode shows stable cycling performance (capacity retention of 70.0% over 100 cycles at 25°C and 60.3% over 90 cycles at 55°C with a current density of 500 mA g-1) and a superior rate capacity of 864.1 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 (25°C). The improved electrochemical performance of the Si@CNO electrode is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity and structural stability.">

Additionally, fluoride or fluorinated compounds, as inevitably present in LIB electrolytes, can hamper or even damage recycling processes in industry and have to be removed from the solid LIB parts, as well. Finally, extraction is a necessary tool for LIB electrolyte aging analysis as well as for post-mortem investigations in general, because a qualitative overview can already be achieved after a few minutes of extraction for well-aged, apparently &quot;dry&quot; LIB cells, where the electrolyte is deeply penetrated or even gellified in the solid battery materials.">

This review presents the recent advances on battery separators based on PVDF and its copolymers for lithium-ion batteries. It is divided into the following sections: single polymer and co-polymers, surface modification, composites, and polymer blends.

The active material loading was maintained very high (~2 mg cm-2) to implement electrode engineering close to commercial loading scales. The densification was optimized to balance between the electrode thickness and wettability to enable the best electrochemical properties of the Si/alloy anodes. In this case, engineering and optimizing the Si/alloy composite electrodes to 3 ton calendering (electrode densification from 0.39 to 0.48 g cm-3) showed enhanced cycling stability with a high capacity retention of ~100% over 100 cycles.">

The surface modification of commercial LiFePO4 (LFP) by utilizing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) offers new possibilities for commercial LFP with high electrochemical performances. In this work, the carbonized ZIF-8 (CZIF-8) was coated on the surface of LFP particles by the in situ growth and carbonization of ZIF-8. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that there is an approximate 10 nm coating layer with metal zinc and graphite-like carbon on the surface of LFP/CZIF-8 sample. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherm suggests that the coating layer has uniform and simple connecting mesopores. As cathode material, LFP/CZIF-8 cathode-active material delivers a discharge specific capacity of 159.3 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and a discharge specific energy of 141.7 mWh g-1 after 200 cycles at 5.0C (the retention rate is approximate 99%). These results are attributed to the synergy improvement of the conductivity, the lithium ion diffusion coefficient, and the degree of freedom for volume change of LFP/CZIF-8 cathode. This work will contribute to the improvement of the cathode materials of commercial LIB.">

The matrix provides a highly electronic conductive network that facilitates the lithiation/delithiation of Bi. Additionally, it restrains aggregation of Bi nanoparticles and serves as a buffer layer to alleviate the mechanical strain of Bi nanoparticles upon Li insertion/extraction. With these contributions, Bi@NC exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate capacity compared to bare Bi nanoparticles or their simple composites with carbon.

Cellulose, dissolved in Thiourea/NaOH aqueous solution is chosen as carbon sources and mixed with graphene oxide via a spray-coagulation method using graphene suspension as coagulation bath. The resulted cellulose/graphene suspension is utilized as solvent for dissolving of Ni(NO₃)₂ and then used as raw materials for hydrothermal preparation of the Ni₃S₂@C/RGO composites. The structure of the composites has been investigated and their electrochemical properties are evaluated as anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The Ni₃S₂@C/RGO sample exhibits increasing reversible capacities upon cycles and shows a superior rate performance as well. Such kinds of promising performance have been ascribed to the wrapping effect of carbon layer which confines the dislocation of the polycrystals formed upon cycles and the enhanced conductivity as the integration of RGO conductive substrate. Discharge capacities up to 850 and 630 mAh·g-1 at current densities of 200 and 5000 mA·g-1, respectively, are obtained.

Herein, we develop a simple and facile solution method to prepare red phosphorus nanoparticles (RP NPs). PCl3 readily reacts with HSiCl3 in the presence of amines at room temperature to produce amorphous RP NPs with sizes about 100-200 nm in high yields. When used as an anode for rechargeable lithium ion battery, the RP NP electrode exhibits good electrochemical performance with a reversible capacity of 1380 mA h g- 1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g- 1, and Coulombic efficiencies reaching almost 100% for each cycle.

The reaction principles for the synthesis of LiFePO₄/C composite were analyzed, suggesting that almost no wastewater and air polluted gases are discharged into the environment. The morphological, structural and compositional properties of the LiFePO₄/C composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra coupled with thermogravimetry/Differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) thermal analysis in detail. Lithium-ion batteries using such LiFePO₄/C composite as cathode materials, where the loading level is 2.2 mg/cm², exhibited excellent electrochemical performances, with a discharge capability of 161 mA h/g at 0.1 C, 119 mA h/g at 10 C and 93 mA h/g at 20 C, and a cycling stability with 98.0% capacity retention at 1 C after 100 cycles and 95.1% at 5 C after 200 cycles. These results provide a valuable approach to reduce the manufacturing costs of LiFePO₄/C cathode materials due to the reduced process for the polluted exhaust purification and wastewater treatment.">

The NiO nanosheets were designed two kinds of morphologies, which are porous and non-porous. By the NiO nanosheets coating, the major active CuO nanowires were protected from direct contact with the electrolyte to improve the surface chemical stability. Simultaneously, through the observation and comparison of TEM results of crystalline non-porous NiO nanosheets, before and after lithiation process, we clearly prove the effect of expected protection of CuO, and clarify the differences of phase transition, crystallinity change, ionic conduction and the mechanisms of the capacity decay further. Subsequently, the electrochemical performances exhibit lithiation and delithiation differences of the porous and non-porous NiO nanosheets, and confirm that the presence of the non-porous NiO coating can still effectively assist the diffusion of Li+ ions into the CuO nanowires, maintaining the advantage of high surface area, and improves the cycle performance of CuO nanowires, leading to enhanced battery capacity. Optimally, the best structure is validated to be non-porous NiO nanosheets, in contrary to the anticipated porous NiO nanosheets. In addition, considering the low cost and facile fabrication process can be realized further for practical applications.">

Printed cells exhibited high electrical conductivity and adhesion between current collectors and inks, i.e., up to 64 ± 1 J/m². Electrochemical cycling tests at C/10 showed a reversible capacity during the first cycle of about 80 mAh/g, which slightly decayed upon cycling.

Herein, a series of NiO/NiFe2O4 hetero-structures with adjustable porosity, particle size, and shell/internal structure have been synthesized via a controllable annealing process. The optimized NiO/NiFe2O4 (S-NFO) is hierarchical hollow nanocube that is composed of ~5 nm subunits and high porosity. When being applied as anode for LIBs, the S-NFO exhibits high rate capability and excellent cycle stability, which remains high capacity of 1,052 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 5.0 A g-1 and even 344 mAh g-1 after 2,000 cycles at 20 A g-1. Such impressive electrochemical performance of S-NFO is mainly due to three reasons. One is high porosity of its hierarchical hollow shell, which not only promotes the penetration of electrolyte, but also accommodates the volume change during cycling. Another is the small particle size of its subunits, which can effectively shorten the electron/ion diffusion distance and provide more active sites for Li+ storage. Besides, the hetero-interfaces between NiO and NiFe2O4 also contribute toitsfast charge transport.">

Nanofibril membranes showed water contact angles as low as 18°, negligible size change at a heating temperature of 160 °C for 120 min, and tensile strength up to 137.6 MPa. The homogenization was found to strongly contribute to these improved performances.

Nonetheless, for the veritable accomplishment with regards to high-energy demand, alloy-based anodes must be evaluated considering several crucial factors that determine volumetric capacity. In particular, the electrode swelling upon cycling must be contemplated if these anodes are to replace conventional graphite anodes in terms of volumetric capacity. Herein, we propose macropore-coordinated graphite-silicon composite by incorporating simulation and mathematical calculation of numerical values from experimental data. This unique structure exhibits minimized electrode swelling comparable to conventional graphite under industrial electrode fabrication conditions. Consequently, this hybrid anode, even with high specific capacity (527 mAh g-1) and initial coulombic efficiency (93%) in half-cell, achieves higher volumetric capacity (493.9 mAh cm-3) and energy density (1825.7 Wh L-1) than conventional graphite (361.4 mAh cm-3 and 1376.3 Wh L-1) after 100 cycles in the full-cell configuration.">

The growing market for electro mobility has led to a growing global demand for Li, Co, Ni, and Mn, making spent lithium-ion batteries a valuable secondary resource. Going forward, energy- and resource-inefficient pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical recycling strategies must be avoided. We presented an approach to recover NMC particles from spent lithium-ion battery cathodes while preserving their chemical and morphological properties, with a minimal use of chemicals. The key task was the separation of the cathode coating layer consisting of NMC, an organic binder, and carbon black, from the Al substrate foil. This can be performed in water under strong agitation to support the slow detachment process. However, the contact of the NMC cathode with water leads to a release of Li⁺ ions and a fast increase in the pH. Unwanted side reactions may occur as the Al substrate foil starts to dissolve and Al(OH)₃ precipitates on the NMC. These side reactions are avoided using pH-adjusted solutions with sufficiently high buffer capacities to separate the coating layer from the Al substrate, without precipitations and without degradation of the NMC particles.">

The paper presents an approach to parameterize and compare electrode material performance based on mechanical stability. A mathematical model was developed to determine particle deformation and stress fields based upon an elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive response. Mechanical deformation was computed by combining the stress equilibrium equations with the electrochemical diffusion of lithium ions into the electrode particle. The result provided a time developing stress field which shifts from purely elastic to partially plastic deformation as the lithium-ion diffuses into the particle. The model was used to derive five merit indices that parameterize mechanical stability of electrode materials. The merit indices were used to analyze the mechanical stability for the six candidate electrode materials-three for anode materials and three for the cathode material. Finally, the paper suggests ways to improve the mechanical performance of electrode materials and identifies mechanical properties that need to be considered for selection and optimal design of electrode materials.">

Compared with the PE separator, both the uptake and wettability with the electrolyte and water of CCS-CS-PDA are improved significantly. Meanwhile, when saturated with liquid electrolyte, the CCS-CS-PDA also shows enabled high ionic conductance. Furthermore, the test of the electrochemical impedances changing with the temperatures suggests that only the PE separator exhibits no thermal shutdown behaviors, and the CCS-CS separator only has a shutdown temperature range from 138 to 160 °C, while the CCS-CS-PDA shows a shutdown temperature range from 138 to more than 200 °C.

We find surprisingly, after cycling, ruthenium segregates out as metallic nanoclusters on the reconstructed surface. Our calculations show that the unexpected ruthenium metal segregation is due to its thermodynamic insolubility in the oxygen deprived surface. This insolubility can disrupt the reconstructed surface, which explains the formation of a porous structure in this material. This work reveals the importance of studying the thermodynamic stability of the reconstructed film on the cathode materials and offers a theoretical guidance for choosing manganese substituting elements in lithium-rich as well as stoichiometric layer-layer compounds for stabilizing the cathode surface.">

Their reliability is directly related to the life and safe operation of the electric drive products. In fact, the cells have a dependent relationship with the degradation process and they affect the degradation rate of the entire battery pack, thereby affecting its reliability. At present, most research focuses on the reliability of battery packs and assumes that their cells are independent of each other, which may cause the reliability of the evaluation to deviate greatly from the actual level. In order to accurately assess the reliability of lithium-ion batteries, it is necessary to build a reliability model considering the dependency among cells for the overall degradation of lithium-ion battery packs. Therefore, in this study, based on a lithium-ion battery degradation test, the Wiener process is used to analyze the reliability of four basic configurations of lithium-ion battery packs. According to the degradation data of the battery packs, the Copula function is used to quantitatively describe the dependent relationship in the degradation process of a single battery, and the quantitative dependent relationship is combined with the reliability model to form a new reliability model. Finally, taking the battery system of Tesla S as an example, a feasible optimization method for battery pack design is provided based on the model constructed in this work.">

In this work, we put forward to introduce dual carbonaceous materials synergetic protection to overcome the drawbacks of the silicon anode. The silicon nanoparticle was coated by pyrolysed carbon, and meanwhile anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide, to form a self-standing film composite (C@Si/rGO). The C@Si/rGO film electrode displays high flexibility and an ordered porous structure, which could not only buffer the Si nanoparticle expansion during lithiation/delithiation processes, but also provides the channels for fast electron transfer and lithium ion transport. Therefore, the self-standing C@Si/rGO film electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 1002 mAh g-1 over 100 cycles and exhibits much better rate capability, validating it as a promising anode for constructing high performance lithium-ion batteries.">

Octavinyl-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane has an inorganic core (-Si₈O12) and an organic vinyl shell. Carbonization of the core-shell structured organic-inorganic hybrid precursor results in the formation of carbon protected Si-based anode material applicable for lithium ion battery. The initial discharge capacity of the battery based on the as-obtained Si@C material Si reaches 1500 mAh g-1. After 550 charge-discharge cycles, a high capacity of 1430 mAh g-1 was maintained. A combined XRD, XPS and TEM analysis was performed to investigate the variation of the discharge performance during the cycling experiments. The results show that the decrease in discharge capacity in the first few cycles is related to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The subsequent rise in the capacity can be ascribed to the gradual morphology evolution of the anode material and the loss of capacity after long-term cycles is due to the structural pulverization of silicon within the electrode. Our results not only show the high potential of the novel electrode material but also provide insight into the dynamic features of the material during battery cycling, which is useful for the future design of high-performance electrode material.">

The ReS2@CB nanocomposite showed high specific capacities of 760, 667, 600, 525, and 473 mAh/g at the current densities of 0.1 (0.23 C), 0.2 (0.46 C), 0.3 (0.7 C), 0.5 (1.15 C) and 1.0 A/g (2.3 C), respectively, in conjunction with its excellent cycling performance (432 mAh/g at 2.3 C; 91.4% capacity retention) after 100 cycles. Such LIB performance is greatly higher than pure CB and ReS2 powder samples. These results could be due to the following reasons: (1) the low-cost CB serves as a supporter enabling the formation of ≈1-4 layered nanosheets of ReS2, thus avoiding its agglomeration; (2) the CB enhances the electrical conductivity of the ReS2@CB nanocomposite; (3) the ultra-thin (1-4 layers) ReS2 nanosheets with imperfect structure can function as increasing the number of active sites for reaction of Li+ ions with electrolytes. The outstanding performance and unique structural characteristics of the ReS2@CB anodes make them promising candidates for the ever-increasing development of advanced LIBs.">

Results showed that the close-packed spherical PVDF simultaneously improved electrochemical capacity and cyclability because the free-volume between the spherical PVDF helped to accommodate the volume change in the anode caused by the Li ions discharge and charge processes. Furthermore, the Ni nanoparticles decorated on the surface of ZnO NRs enhanced the electrical conductivity of the ZnO NR anode, which enabled faster electronic and ionic transport at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode, resulting in improved electrochemical capacity. The free-volume formed by the close-packed spherical PVDF, and the decoration of metal nanoparticles are expected to provide insight on the simultaneous improvement of electrochemical capacity and cyclability in other metal oxide anode nanostructures.">

This model provided a reliable method and basis for solving the visualization of ultrasonic propagation in a lithium-ion battery and the analysis of ultrasonic time-frequency domain characteristics. The finite element simulation analysis and experimental verification of a lithium-ion battery with a near-surface stomata defect, near-bottom stomata defect and middle-layer stomata defect were performed. The results showed that the air-coupled ultrasonic transmission signal can effectively characterize the stomata defect inside a lithium-ion battery. The energy of an air-coupled ultrasonic transmission signal is concentrated between 350-450 kHz, and the acoustic diffraction effect has an important influence on the effect of the ultrasonic and stomata defect. Based on the amplitude response characteristics of the air-coupled ultrasonic transmission wave in the stomata defect area, a C-scan of the lithium-ion battery was performed. The C-scan result verified that air-coupled ultrasonic testing technology can accurately and effectively detect the pre-embedded stomata defect and natural stomata defect in a lithium-ion battery, which is able to promote and expand the application of the technology in the field of electric energy security.">

Based on the principle of rocking-chair lithium-ion batteries, cathode material LiFePO4 is applied to extract lithium from brine, and a novel lithium-ion battery system of LiFePO4 | NaCl solution | anion-exchange membrane | brine | FePO4 is constructed. In this method, Li+ is selectively absorbed from the brine by FePO4 (Li+ + e + FePO4 = LiFePO4); meanwhile, Li+ is desorbed from LiFePO4 (LiFePO4 - e = Li+ + FePO4) and enriched efficiently. To treat a raw brine solution, the Mg/Li ratio decreases from the initial 134.4 in the brine to 1.2 in the obtained anolyte and 83% lithium is extracted. For the treatment of an old brine solution, the Mg/Li ratio decreases from the initial 48.4 in the brine to 0.5 and the concentration of lithium in the anolyte is accumulated about six times (from the initial 0.51 g L-1 in the brine to 3.2 g L-1 in the anolyte), with the absorption capacity of about 25 mg (Li) g (LiFePO4)-1. Additionally, it displays a great perspective on the application in light of its high selectively, good cycling performance, effective lithium enrichment, environmental friendliness, low cost, and avoidance of poisonous organic reagents and harmful acid or oxidant.">

The vital challenge is the determination of appropriate synthetic system that can benefit the formation of respective precursors in a structure or single-source precursors of tin and other metal species. In the current work, by the aids of synergy action between l-proline and ethylene glycol (EG), precursors containing two metal ions are generally fabricated.

The morphological and structural measurements show that the SiCN materials are mixtures of nanocrystals of SiC, Si3N4, and graphite. The SiCN materials have been used as anodes for lithium-ion batteries. Among the five polymer-derived SiCN materials, 5#SiCN, derived from dichloromethylvinylsilane and di-n-octyldichlorosilane, has the best cycle stability and a high-rate performance at the low cutoff voltage of 0.01-1.0 V. In lithium-ion half-cells, the specific delithiation capacity of 5#SiCN anode still remains at 826.7 mA h g-1 after 100 charge/discharge cycles; it can even deliver the capacity above 550 mA h g-1 at high current densities of 1.6 and 2 A g-1. In lithium-ion full cells, 5#SiCN anode works well with LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 commercial cathode. The outstanding electrochemical performance of 5#SiCN anode is attributed to two factors: (1) the formation of a stable and compact solid electrolyte interface layer on the anode surface anode, which protects the electrode from cracking during the charge/discharge cycle; and (2) a large amount of carbon component and the less Si3N4 phase in the 5#SiCN structure, which provides an electrochemical reactive and conductive environment in the SiCN structure, benefit the lithiation/delithiation process. In addition, we explore the reason for the capacity fading of these SiCN anodes.">

A PIL-based electrolyte by mixing this poly(ionic liquid) with additives of 10 wt % propylene carbonate and 0.1 M LiClO4 is proved to be an excellent electrolyte for lithium-ion battery. The obtained PIL-based electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 8.3 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 25 °C and 2.0 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 60 °C and a wide electrochemical potential window up to 5.61 V at 25 °C and 4.14 V at 60 °C. The Li/LiFePO4 batteries equipped with this PIL-based electrolyte achieve high capacity, outstanding cycling stability and rate capability at 25 °C, and even improved performance at high temperature like 60 °C. Such excellent performances of batteries are attributed to the formation of stable solid-electrolyte interface film at the lithium-electrolyte interface and the stability of electrolyte during cycling.">

The formation of the CQD-Bi2O3 composite was confirmed by UV-vis absorption, steady-state emission, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy studies. The crystal structure and chemical composition of the composite were examined by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The surface morphology and the particle size distribution of the CQD-Bi2O3 were examined using field emission scanning electron microscope and high-resolution transmission electron microscope observations. As an anode material in lithium-ion battery, the CQD-Bi2O3 composite exhibited good electrochemical activity and delivered a discharge capacity as high as 1500 mA h g-1 at 0.2C rate. The supercapacitor properties of the CQD-Bi2O3 composite electrode revealed good reversibility and a high specific capacity of 343 C g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in 3 M KOH. The asymmetric device constructed using the CQD-Bi2O3 and reduced graphene oxide delivered a maximum energy density of 88 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 2799 W kg-1, while the power density reached a highest value of 8400 W kg-1 at the energy density of 32 Wh kg-1. The practical viability of the fabricated device is demonstrated by glowing light-emitting diodes. It is inferred that the presence of conductive carbon network has significantly increased the conductivity of the oxide matrix, thereby reducing the interfacial resistance that resulted in excellent electrochemical performances.">

The final product, AC&lt;nc-Si&gt;AC, exhibited an aggregated structure of activated-carbon-encapsulated nanocrystalline silicon spheres, and reveals a high specific surface area (498.5 m2/g). Owing to the mutualization of advantages from both silicon nanocrystals (i.e., low discharge potential and high specific capacity) and activated carbon (i.e., high porosity and good electrical conductivity), the AC&lt;nc-Si&gt;AC nanocomposites are able to play a substantial role as an anodic source material for the lithium-ion battery (LIB). Namely, a high coulombic efficiency (97.5%), a high discharge capacity (716 mAh/g), and a high reversible specific capacity (429 mAh/g after 100 cycles) were accomplished when using AC&lt;nc-Si&gt;AC as an LIB anode.

Sn4P3/C composite powders prepared by a ball milling was used as raw material and deposited onto a stainless steel substrate to form the composite film via impact consolidation. The Sn4P3/C composite film fabricated by AD showed much better electrochemical performance than the Sn4P3 film without complexing carbon. Although both films showed initial discharge (Li+ extraction) capacities of approximately 1000 mAh g-1, Sn4P3/C films retained higher reversible capacity above 700 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles of charge and discharge processes while the capacity of Sn4P3 film rapidly degraded with cycling. In addition, by controlling the potential window in galvanostatic testing, Sn4P3/C composite film retained the reversible capacity of 380 mAh g-1 even after 400 cycles. The complexed carbon works not only as a buffer to suppress the collapse of electrodes by large volume change of Sn4P3 in charge and discharge reactions but also as an electronic conduction path among the atomized active material particles in the film.">

The exploitation of flexible electrodes with high mechanical properties and superior electrochemical performances has been a key challenge for the rapid practical application of flexible LIBs. Herein, a flexible composite electrode was prepared from the mixed solutions of Li[Li0.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54]O2 (LLOs), carbon nanotubes(CNTs), and nanofibrillated celluloses (NFCs) via a vacuum filtration method. The resulting LLOs/CNTs/NFCs electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 253 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C in the voltage range from 2.0 to 4.6 V, and retained a reversible capacity of 178 mAh g-1 with 83% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C. The LLOs/CNTs/NFCs electrode exhibited excellent flexibility along with repeated bending in the bending test. The LLOs/CNTs/NFCs electrode after bending test remained a discharge capacity of 149 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 1 C, and the corresponding capacity retentions was 76%. The excellent electrochemical performance and high flexibility can be ascribed to the framework formed by CNTs with high conductivity and NFCs with good mechanical properties. The results imply that the as-fabricated electrode can be a promising candidate for the flexible LIBs.">

During the charge process, a more effective Li extraction from a side facet of the single crystalline LCO particle than from the central part is observed, which ensures the reliability of the system as an operando microscopic photoelectron analyzer that can track changes in the electronic structure of a selected part of the active particle. Based on these assessments, the no drastic change in the Co 2p XPS spectra during charge-discharge of LCO supports that the charge-polarization may occur at the oxygen side by strong hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p orbitals.

        <span class="abst" title="Developed societies with advanced economic performance are undoubtedly coupled with the availability of electrical energy. Whilst industrialized nations already started to decrease associated carbon emissions in many business sectors, e.g., by substituting combustion engines with battery-powered vehicles, less developed countries still lack broad coverage of reliable electricity supply, particularly in rural regions. Progressive electrification leads to a need for storage capacity and thus to increasing availability of advanced battery systems. To achieve a high degree of sustainability, re-used batteries from the electromobility sector are appropriate, as they do not consume further primary resources and still have sufficient residual capacity for stationary electrical storage applications. In this article, a blueprint for the electrification of a remote region by utilizing second-life lithium ion traction batteries for an integrated energy system in a stand-alone grid is presented and the implementation by the example case of a Tanzanian island in Lake Victoria is demonstrated. First, economic potentials and expected trends in the disposability of second-life lithium ion batteries and their foreseeable costs are outlined. Subsequently, key decision variables are identified to evaluate logistic aspects and the feasibility of the implementation of an off-grid electrical system in remote areas for economically and geographically unfavorable environments. The practical realization is pictured in detail with a focus on technical performance and safety specificities associated with second-life applications. Therefore, a new type of battery management system is introduced, which meets the special requirements of climate compatibility, low maintenance, enhanced cell balancing capability and cell configuration flexibility, and combined with a fiber-optical sensor system, provides reliable status monitoring of the battery. By carrying out on-site measurements, the overall system efficiency is evaluated along with a sustainability analysis. Finally, the socioeconomic and humanitarian impact for the people on the island is debated.">

In this paper, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethyl acrylate (EOEOEA) and LiBF4 electrolyte were mixed as precursors of gel polymer electrolytes. Through thermal curing, a thermally stable GPE with high ionic conductivity (5.60 × 10-4 s/cm at 30 °C) and wide room temperature electrochemical window (4.65 V) was prepared, and the properties of the GPE were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), AC impedance spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric analysis (TG), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. On the basis of the in-situ deep polymerization on a LiFePO4 electrode and cellulose membrane in a battery case, EOEOEA-based GPE could be derived on both LiFePO4 electrode and cellulose membrane. Meanwhile, the contact between GPE, LiFePO4 electrode, and lithium electrode was promoted. The capacity retention rate of the as-prepared LiBF4-EOEOEA 30% gel lithium battery reached 100% under the condition of 0.1 °C after 50 cycles, and the Coulombic efficiency was over 99%. Meanwhile, the growth of lithium dendrite could be effectively inhibited. GPE can be applied in high-performance lithium batteries.">

From the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, it can be seen that a layer with a honeycombed porous structure is formed on the membrane. The thus-formed composite separator imbibed with the electrolyte solution has an ionic conductivity of 0.474 mS/cm with an electrolyte uptake of 335%. At 175 °C, the assembled battery from the synthesized composite separator explodes at 3200 s, which is five times longer than the battery assembled from an Al2O3-coated polyethylene (PE) membrane. The open circuit voltage of the assembled battery using a composite separator drops to zero at 600 s at an operating temperature of 185 °C, while the explosion of the battery with Al2O3-coated PE occurs at 250 s. More importantly, the interface resistance of the cell assembled from the composite separator decreases to 65 Ω. Hence, as the discharge rate increases from 0.2 to 1.0 C, the discharge capacity of the battery using composite separator retains 93.5%. Under 0.5 C, the discharge capacity retention remains 99.4% of its initial discharge capacity after 50 charge-discharge cycles. The results described here demonstrate that Al2O3/PPTA-coated polyethylene membranes have superior thermal stability and ion diffusion.">

An advanced RTD is embedded in a 3D printed polymeric substrate and placed behind the electrode current collector of CR2032 coin cells that can sustain harsh electrochemical operational environments (acidic electrolyte without Redox, short-circuiting, leakage etc.) without participating in electrochemical reactions. The internal RTD measured an average 5.8 °C higher temperature inside the cells than the external RTD with almost 10 times faster detection ability, prohibiting thermal runaway events without interfering in the LIBs' operation. A temperature prediction model is developed to forecast battery surface temperature rise stemming from measured internal and external RTD temperature signatures.">

In this study, we investigated the possibility of using such collected silicon oxides (SiOx) particles as an anode material. After collecting SiOx particles, FE-SEM, TEM, EDS, XRD, XPS analysis, and charge/discharge test were carried out to investigate characteristics and usability of these particles. FE-SEM and FE-TEM images showed that these particles mainly consisted of spherical primary particles with a diameter of 10 nm or less. Agglomerates of these primary particles were larger than 300 nm in diameter. In TEM image and EDS analysis, crystalline particles were observed along with amorphous particles. As a result of XRD analysis, amorphous silica (SiO2) and crystalline Si were observed. Charge/discharge tests were carried out to determine the feasibility of using these particles as an anode material for lithium ion batteries. A cycle efficiency of 40.6% was obtained in the test in which the total number of charge/discharge cycle was 100 under the condition of C-rate 0.2 for the first three times and C-rate 1.0 for the remaining 97 times.

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Li-ion batteries (LIB) are increasingly used worldwide. They are made of low solubility micrometric particles, implying a potential for inhalation toxicity in occupational settings and possibly for consumers. LiCoO2 (LCO), one of the most used cathode material, induces inflammatory and fibrotic lung responses in mice. LCO also stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) -1α, a factor implicated in inflammation, fibrosis and carcinogenicity. Here, we investigated the role of cobalt, nickel and HIF-1α as determinants of toxicity, and evaluated their predictive value for the lung toxicity of LIB particles in in vitro assays. RESULTS:By testing a set of 5 selected LIB particles (LCO, LiNiMnCoO2, LiNiCoAlO2) with different cobalt and nickel contents, we found a positive correlation between their in vivo lung inflammatory activity, and (i) Co and Ni particle content and their bioaccessibility and (ii) the stabilization of HIF-1α in the lung. Inhibition of HIF-1α with chetomin or PX-478 blunted the lung inflammatory response to LCO in mice. In IL-1β deficient mice, HIF-1α was the upstream signal of the inflammatory lung response to LCO. In vitro, the level of HIF-1α stabilization induced by LIB particles in BEAS-2B cells correlated with the intensity of lung inflammation induced by the same particles in vivo. CONCLUSIONS:We conclude that HIF-1α, stabilized in lung cells by released Co and Ni ions, is a mechanism-based biomarker of lung inflammatory responses induced by LIB particles containing Co/Ni. Documenting the Co/Ni content of LIB particles, their bioaccessibility and their capacity to stabilize HIF-1α in vitro can be used to predict the lung inflammatory potential of LIB particles.">

Particularly, silicon particles are attracting increased attention as energy storage materials for lithium-ion batteries. However, silicon has a limited cycling performance owing to its peeling from the current collector and the volume expansion that occurs during alloying with lithium in the charging process. Significant contributors to this problem are the even distribution of silicon nanoparticles within the carbon matrix and their deep placement in the internal structure. In this study, we synthesized silicon nanoparticles and carbon materials via a bottom-up approach using a new method called plasma in solution. Silicon nanoparticles and the carbon matrix were synthesized in a structure similar to carbon black. It was confirmed that the silicon particles were evenly distributed in the carbon matrix. In addition, the evaluation of the electrochemical performance of the silicon-carbon matrix (Si-C) composite material showed that it exhibited stable cycling performance with high reversible capacity.">

For high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries, a dense electrode with low porosity is desired to minimize electrolyte intake, parasitic weight, and cost. Here we report the profound impact on the discharge polarization, reversible capacity, and cell cycling life of lithium-sulfur batteries by decreasing cathode porosities from 70 to 40%. According to the developed mechanism-based analytical model, we demonstrate that sulfur utilization is limited by the solubility of lithium-polysulfides and further conversion from lithium-polysulfides to Li2S is limited by the electronically accessible surface area of the carbon matrix. Finally, we predict an optimized cathode porosity to maximize the cell level volumetric energy density without sacrificing the sulfur utilization.">

Here, a series of ceramic nanoparticle-coated nanofiber membranes, including Al2O3/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), SiO2/PVDF, and Al2O3/SiO2/PVDF, were prepared by melt-electrospinning and magnetron sputtering deposition. Among all of these composite separators, Al2O3/SiO2/PVDF showed several advantages including excellent thermal stability (no dimensional shrinkage at temperature up to 130 °C and an onset degradation temperature of 445 °C) and superb electrolyte compatibility (340% electrolyte uptake). In addition, the β phase of the fibrous PVDF membrane as well as the presence of polar ceramic nanoparticles on the fiber surface can synergistically improve the ion conductivity to 2.055 mS/cm at room temperature, which is more than 8 times higher than that of the commercial polyethylene (PE) separator. Performance of these ceramic nanoparticle-coated separators in a lithium-ion battery demonstrated an improved discharge capacity of 161.5 mAh/g and more than 84.3% capacity retention rate after 100 cycles. The ceramic nanoparticle-coated PVDF separators also maintained 58.4% capacity at a high current density of 8C, which is better than the 49.8% capacity for the commercial PE separator.

However, a better understanding of their nature is still required to improve battery management systems (BMS). Overvoltages and open-circuit voltage (OCV) hysteresis provide valuable information regarding battery performance, but estimations of these parameters are generally inaccurate, leading to errors in BMS. Studies on hysteresis are commonly avoided because the hysteresis depends on the state of charge and degradation level and requires time-consuming measurements. We have investigated hysteresis and overvoltages in Li(NiMnCo)O2/graphite and LiFePO4/graphite commercial cells. Here we report a direct relationship between an increase in OCV hysteresis and an increase in charge overvoltage when the cells are degraded by cycling. We find that the hysteresis is related to diffusion and increases with the formation of pure phases, being primarily related to the graphite electrode. These findings indicate that the graphite electrode is a determining factor for cell efficiency.">

However, its impact on the cathode behavior remains poorly understood. Here we show the correlation between capacity fading and phase/surface stability of an LiMn2O4 cathode. It is revealed that a combination of structural transformation and transition metal dissolution dominates the cathode capacity fading. LiMn2O4 exhibits irreversible phase transitions driven by manganese(III) disproportionation and Jahn-Teller distortion, which in conjunction with particle cracks results in serious manganese dissolution. Meanwhile, fast manganese dissolution in turn triggers irreversible structural evolution, and as such, forms a detrimental cycle constantly consuming active cathode components. Furthermore, lithium-rich LiMn2O4 with lithium/manganese disorder and surface reconstruction could effectively suppress the irreversible phase transition and manganese dissolution. These findings close the loop of understanding capacity fading mechanisms and allow for development of longer life batteries.">

Due to the high production cost and significant environmental impacts associated with the production of lithium-ion nickel-manganese-cobalt (Li-ion NMC) batteries, several chemistries are proposed as a potential substitute. This study aims to identify and compare the lifecycle environmental impacts springing from a novel Al-ion battery, with the current state-of-the-art chemistry, i.e., Li-ion NMC. The global warming potential (GWP) indicator was selected to express the results due to its relevance to society, policy and to facilitate the comparison of our results with other research. The cradle-to-grave process-based assessment uses two functional units: (1) per-cell manufactured and (2) per-Wh of storage capacity. The results identified the battery's production as the highest carbon intensity phase, being the energy usage the main contributor to GWP. In general, the materials and process involved in the manufacturing and recycling of the novel battery achieve a lower environmental impact in comparison to the Li-ion technology. However, due to the Al-ion's low energy density, a higher amount of materials are needed to deliver equivalent performance than a Li-ion.">

A serious limitation, however, is the slow charging rate used to obtain the full capacity. Thus far, there have been no ways to increase the charging rate without losses in energy density and electrochemical performance. Here we show that the charging rate of a cathode can be dramatically increased via interaction with white light. We find that a direct exposure of light to an operating LiMn2O4 cathode during charging leads to a remarkable lowering of the battery charging time by a factor of two or more. This enhancement is enabled by the induction of a microsecond long-lived charge separated state, consisting of Mn4+ (hole) plus electron. This results in more oxidized metal centers and ejected lithium ions are created under light and with voltage bias. We anticipate that this discovery could pave the way to the development of new fast recharging battery technologies.">

Lithium metal is a promising candidate as the anode material due to its high theoretical specific capacity, negative electrochemical potential and favorable density. However, during cycling, low and uneven lithium ion concentration on the surface of anode usually results in uncontrolled dendrite growth, especially at high current densities. Here we tackle this issue by using lithiophilic montmorillonite as an additive in the ether-based electrolyte to regulate the lithium ion concentration on the anode surface and thus facilitate the uniform lithium deposition. The lithiophilic montmorillonite demonstrates a pumping feature that improves the self-concentrating kinetics of the lithium ion and thus accelerates the lithium ion transfer at the deposition/electrolyte interface. The signal intensity of TFSI- shows negligible changes via in situ Raman tracking of the ion flux at the electrochemical interface, indicating homogeneous ion distribution, which can lead to a stable and uniform lithium deposition on the anode surface. Our study indicates that the interfacial engineering induced by the lithiophilic montmorillonite could be a promising strategy to optimize the lithium deposition for next-generation lithium metal batteries.">

Here, an optimized reduced graphene oxide/silicon (RGO/Si) composite with excellent stability has been fabricated via a facile templated self-assembly strategy. The active silicon nanoparticles were uniformly supported by graphene that can further form a three-dimensional network to buffer the volume change of Si and produce a stable solid-electrolyte interphase film due to the increased specific surface area and enhanced intermolecular interaction, resulting in an increase of electrical conductivity and structural stability. As the anode electrode material of lithium-ion batteries, the optimized 10RGO/Si-600 composite showed a reversible high capacity of 2317 mA h/g with an initial efficiency of 93.2% and a quite high capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A/g rate.

The supramolecular lithium ion conductor utilizes orthogonally functional H-bonding domains and ion-conducting domains to create a polymer electrolyte with unprecedented toughness (29.3 MJ m-3) and high ionic conductivity (1.2 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C). Implementation of the supramolecular ion conductor as a binder material allows for the creation of stretchable lithium-ion battery electrodes with strain capability of over 900% via a conventional slurry process. The supramolecular nature of these battery components enables intimate bonding at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Combination of these stretchable components leads to a stretchable battery with a capacity of 1.1 mAh cm-2 that functions even when stretched to 70% strain. The method reported here of decoupling ionic conductivity from mechanical properties opens a promising route to create high-toughness ion transport materials for energy storage applications.">

This study fills this research gap by evaluating the lithium resource impacts from electrification of the heavy-duty segment at the global level. Our results show that a mass electrification of the heavy-duty segment on top of the light-duty segment would substantially increase the lithium demand and impose further strain on the global lithium supply. The significant impact is attributed to the large single-vehicle battery capacity required by heavy-duty vehicles and the expected battery replacement needed within the lifetime of heavy-duty vehicles.

Here, the preparation and characterization of lithium iron phosphate/polylactic acid (LFP/PLA) and SiO2/PLA 3D-printable filaments, specifically conceived respectively as positive electrode and separator in a lithium-ion battery is reported. By means of plasticizer addition, the active material loading within the positive electrode is raised as high as possible (up to 52 wt.%) while still providing enough flexibility to the filament to be printed. A thorough analysis is performed to determine the thermal, electrical and electrochemical effect of carbon black as conductive additive in the positive electrode and the electrolyte uptake impact of ceramic additives in the separator. Considering both optimized filaments composition and using our previously reported graphite/PLA filament for the negative electrode, assembled and &quot;printed in one-shot&quot; complete LFP/Graphite battery cells are 3D-printed and characterized. Taking advantage of the new design capabilities conferred by 3D-printing, separator patterns and infill density are discussed with a view to enhance the liquid electrolyte impregnation and avoid short-circuits.">

The AF is entirely automated and requires fewer or almost no human assistance. The end-to-end pipeline of AF own the following features; (i) intelligently pre-processing the hyperspectral Raman dataset to eliminate the cosmic noise and baseline, (ii) extract all the reliable spectral signatures from the hyperspectral dataset and assign the class labels, (iii) training a neural network (NN) on to the precisely &quot;labelled&quot; spectral signature, and finally, examined the interoperability/reusability of already trained NN on to the newly measured dataset taken from the same LIB specimen or completely different LIB specimen for inline real-time analytics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to quantitatively assess the capacity degradation of LIB via a capacity retention coefficient that can be calculated by comparing the LMO signatures extracted by the analytical framework (AF). The present approach is suited for real-time vibrational spectroscopy based industrial applications; multicomponent chemical reactions, chromatographic, spectroscopic mixtures, and environmental monitoring.">

The synthesized Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 hollow nano/sub-microsphere cathode materials are calcined at 800, 900, 950, and 1000 °C. Among them, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 calcined at 950 °C exhibits a high discharge capacity (277 mAh g-1 at 0.1C rate) and excellent capacity retention (88%) after 50 cycles and also delivers an excellent discharge capacity of &gt;172 mAh g-1 at 5C rate. Good electrochemical performance of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2-950 is directly related to the optimized size of its primary particles (85 nm) (which constitute the spherical secondary particle, ∼720 nm) and homogeneous cation mixing. Higher calcination temperature (≥950 °C) leads to an increase of the primary particle size, poor cycling stability, and inferior rate capacity of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 due to smashing of quasi-hollow spheres upon repeated lithium ion intercalations/deintercalations. Therefore, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2-950 is a promising electrode for the next-generation high-voltage and high-capacity Li-ion battery application.">

After involving montmorillonite (MMT) into the SPEs, the ionic conductivity of SPEs is 4.7 mS cm- 1 at 70 °C which shows a comparable value with that of liquid electrolyte. As coupling with LiFePO4 material, the battery delivers a high discharge capacity of 150.3 mAh g- 1 and an excellent rate performance with a capacity of 111.8 mAh g- 1 at 0.16 C and maintains 58.2 mAh g- 1 at 0.8 C.

Nonaqueous organic electrolytes play a key role in lithium-oxygen batteries, allowing the conduction of lithium ions and oxygen transfer in the three phase boundaries (cathode-gas-electrolyte). Herein, we report the effect of lithium salt concentrations in single-solvent lithium-oxygen battery systems systematically (using bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)) on their electrochemical performances. The first discharge capacities and cyclabilities exhibit favorable correlations with the lithium salt concentration, of which using 0.4 and 1.5 M LiTFSI show the best discharge capacities and cyclabilities. The specific capacity of the 0.4 M LiTFSI system reaches 7000 mAh g-1, about 1.3 times that of the commonly used 1 M LiTFSI in TEGDME. Cyclic voltammetry with slow scan speeds further investigates the system stability and reaction mechanism. The surface morphology after the discharge and interface impedance after charging, which are examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), have significant effects on the comprehensive performances. Conductivity and viscosity play mutual roles in the lithium-oxygen battery performance, while the oxygen solvation has little effect.">

As a result, the amelioration of lithium metal anode is an important means to improve the performance of lithium sulfur battery. In this paper, improvement methods on lithium metal anode for lithium sulfur batteries, including adding electrolyte additives, using solid, and/or gel polymer electrolyte, modifying separators, applying a protective coating, and providing host materials for lithium deposition, are mainly reviewed.

In the present study, a simple electrospinning technique is adopted to prepare highly porous polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based membranes with a higher concentration of lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (LATP) ceramic particles, as a viable alternative to the commercialized separators used in lithium ion batteries. The effect of the LATP particles on the morphology of the porous membranes is demonstrated through Field emission scattering electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectra studies suitably demonstrate the mixing of PAN and LATP particles in the polymer matrix. PAN with 30 wt% LATP (P-L30) exhibits an enhanced porosity of 90% and is more thermally stable, with the highest electrolyte uptake among all the prepared membranes. Due to better electrolyte uptake, the P-L30 membrane demonstrates an improved ionic conductivity of 1.7 mS/cm. A coin cell prepared with a P-L30 membrane and a LiFePO4 cathode demonstrates the highest discharge capacity of 158 mAh/g at 0.5 C-rate. The coin cell with the P-L30 membrane also displays good cycling stability by retaining 97.5% of the initial discharge capacity after 200 cycles of charging and discharging at a 1C rate.">

It was found that the ethanol is suitable to fabricate uniform morphology macroporous separator with the porosity of 92%, electrolyte uptake of 594 wt.%, and strong mechanical strength of 15.9 MPa.

The formation of defective film with improved charge transport and large contact area with a catalyst plays a critical role in the facile decomposition of discharge products and the sustained stability of the battery. Multistaged discharge constructing lithium peroxide-based heterostructure with band discontinuities and a relatively low lithium diffusion barrier may be responsible for the growth of defective film-like discharge products.

In a review two years ago, we focused on the challenges and issues facing lithium metal for solid-state rechargeable batteries, pointed to the progress made in addressing this drawback, and concluded that a situation could be envisioned where solid-state batteries would again win over liquid batteries for different applications in the near future. However, an additional drawback of solid-state batteries is the lower ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Therefore, extensive research efforts have been invested in the last few years to overcome this problem, the reward of which has been significant progress. It is the purpose of this review to report these recent works and the state of the art on solid electrolytes. In addition to solid electrolytes stricto sensu, there are other electrolytes that are mainly solids, but with some added liquid. In some cases, the amount of liquid added is only on the microliter scale; the addition of liquid is aimed at only improving the contact between a solid-state electrolyte and an electrode, for instance. In some other cases, the amount of liquid is larger, as in the case of gel polymers. It is also an acceptable solution if the amount of liquid is small enough to maintain the safety of the cell; such cases are also considered in this review. Different chemistries are examined, including not only Li-air, Li-O2, and Li-S, but also sodium-ion batteries, which are also subject to intensive research. The challenges toward commercialization are also considered.">

The SiC-based inverter exhibited a peak direct current (DC)-alternating current (AC) conversion efficiency higher than that of conventional Si inverters. A Li-ion laminated battery was mounted in the same housing as the inverter. The weight of entire system containing spherical Si solar cell panels was well below 6 kg. Continuous operation measurements of this system were carried out using four solar cell modules connected in parallel under irradiation by natural sunlight. The total inverter efficiencies under realistic operation conditions were slightly decreased compared with the DC-AC converter values because of loss by the maximum power point tracking device. Even under unstable weather conditions, the system provided power stability without ripples. The behaviors of the output powers of the solar cell, storage battery, and inverter modules were analyzed as a function of the solar radiation power density. The substantial efficiencies of the solar cell modules were dependent on the weather conditions and were approximately 10% on cloudy days. The present compact photovoltaic power generation system with SiC device and spherical Si solar cells is viable for sub kW-class inverter.">

However, probing the interplay between charge distribution, grain crystallographic orientation, and performance remains a daunting challenge. Herein, we elucidate the spatially resolved charge distribution in lithium layered oxides with different grain crystallographic arrangements and establish a model to quantify their charge distributions. While the holistic &quot;surface-to-bulk&quot; charge distribution prevails in polycrystalline particles, the crystallographic orientation-guided redox reaction governs the charge distribution in the local charged nanodomains. Compared to the randomly oriented grains, the radially aligned grains exhibit a lower cell polarization and higher capacity retention upon battery cycling. The radially aligned grains create less tortuous lithium ion pathways, thus improving the charge homogeneity as statistically quantified from over 20 million nanodomains in polycrystalline particles. This study provides an improved understanding of the charge distribution and chemomechanical properties of polycrystalline battery materials.">

AATP was synthesized through a substitution reaction of acryloyl chloride. Meanwhile, poly(4-acrylamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-nitroxyl radical) (PTAm) was prepared as a control sample. Then, the structures of products were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), respectively. Additionally, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and the charge-discharge cycling properties were studied. The results demonstrated that the poly(TAm-co-SSS) with the side group of sodium sulfonate adjacent to TEMPO group exhibits a better charge-discharge cycling stability than that of the PTAm. Moreover, the charge specific capacity of the poly(TAm-co-SSS) is larger than that of the PTAm. Besides, the first coulombic efficiency of poly(TAm-co-SSS) is higher in comparison with that of PTAm. These superior electrochemical performances were ascribed to the synergistic effect of sulfonate ions group and nitroxyl radical structure, which benefits the improvement of charge carrier transportation of the nitroxyl radical polymers. Consequently, the nitroxyl radical poly(TAm-co-SSS) is promising for use in organic radical battery materials, based on the good electrochemical properties.">

Here, we report a lignin nanoparticle-coated Celgard (LC) separator to alleviate this problem. The LC separator enables abundant electron-donating groups and is expected to induce chemical binding of polysulfides to hinder the shuttle effect. When a sulfur-containing commercially available acetylene black (approximately 73.8 wt% sulfur content) was used as the cathode without modification, the Li-S battery with the LC separator presented much enhanced cycling stability over that with the Celgard separator for over 500 cycles at a current density of 1 C.

In order to further improve the electrochemical performance of MXenes, the composition, morphology and texture, surface chemistry, and structural configuration of MXenes are extensively investigated. In this mini-review, some recent research and progress of MXenes and MXene-based nanocomposites in lithium-ion capacitors are summarized, which focus on their nanostructure designs and chemical preparation methods, such as prepillaring MXenes, delaminated MXenes, and MXene-based hybrids.

In this study, we prepared nanohybrid materials between polyoxometalate (POM) and porous carbon, which have different porous structures and pore sizes, using different zeolitic templates. The POM molecules were loaded inside the porous carbon, and these POM/carbon nanohybrid materials were used as cathode active materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The performance of these molecular cluster batteries (MCBs) was significantly dependent on the porous carbon. Operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and 7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the POM/carbon-MCBs revealed that three-dimensional porous carbon with high surface areas can improve the performance. The results highlight the remarkable performance of porous carbon with a three-dimensionally-linked pore network structure as an additive for supercapacitors to realise high-performance energy storage devices.">

        <span class="abst" title="Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) was recently applied to the in situ and operando study of the charge/discharge process in Li-ion battery full-cells based on a pouch cell design. Here, this work is continued in a half-cell with a graphite electrode cycled versus a metallic lithium counter electrode, in a study conducted on the SANS-1 instrument of the neutron source FRM II at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum in Garching, Germany. It is confirmed that the SANS integrated intensity signal varies as a function of graphite lithiation, and this variation can be explained by changes in the squared difference in scattering length density between graphite and the electrolyte. The scattering contrast change upon graphite lithiation/delithiation calculated from a multi-phase neutron scattering model is in good agreement with the experimentally measured values. Due to the finite coherence length, the observed SANS contrast, which mostly stems from scattering between the (lithiated) graphite and the electrolyte phase, contains local information on the mesoscopic scale, which allows the development of lithiated phases in the graphite to be followed. The shape of the SANS signal curve can be explained by a core-shell model with step-wise (de)lithiation from the surface. Here, for the first time, X-ray diffraction, SANS and theory are combined to give a full picture of graphite lithiation in a half-cell. The goal of this contribution is to confirm the correlation between the integrated SANS data obtained during operando measurements of an Li-ion half-cell and the electrochemical processes of lithiation/delithiation in micro-scaled graphite particles. For a deeper understanding of this correlation, modelling and experimental data for SANS and results from X-ray diffraction were taken into account.">

Virtual electrode unrolling techniques provide a deeper view inside the electrode layers and are used to detect minor fluctuations which are difficult to observe using conventional three dimensional rendering tools. Moreover, the 'unrolling' provides a platform for correlating multi-modal image data which is expected to find wider application in battery science and engineering to study diverse effects e.g. electrode degradation or lithium diffusion blocking during battery cycling.">

        <span class="abst" title="Lithium-rich layered oxide is one of the most promising candidates for the next-generation cathode materials of high-energy-density lithium ion batteries because of its high discharge capacity. However, it has the disadvantages of uneven composition, voltage decay, and poor rate capacity, which are closely related to the preparation method. Here, 0.5Li2MnO3·0.5LiMn0.8Ni0.1Co0.1O2 was successfully prepared by sol-gel and oxalate co-precipitation methods. A systematic analysis of the materials shows that the 0.5Li2MnO3·0.5LiMn0.8Ni0.1Co0.1O2 prepared by the oxalic acid co-precipitation method had the most stable layered structure and the best electrochemical performance. The initial discharge specific capacity was 261.6 mAh·g-1 at 0.05 C, and the discharge specific capacity was 138 mAh·g-1 at 5 C. The voltage decay was only 210 mV, and the capacity retention was 94.2% after 100 cycles at 1 C. The suppression of voltage decay can be attributed to the high nickel content and uniform element distribution. In addition, tightly packed porous spheres help to reduce lithium ion diffusion energy and improve the stability of the layered structure, thereby improving cycle stability and rate capacity. This conclusion provides a reference for designing high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries.">

In each case, we categorize the individual metals by the overarching cathode material type, focusing on the energy storage mechanism. Specifically, sodium-ion batteries are the closest in technology and chemistry to today's lithium-ion batteries. This lowers the technology transition barrier in the short term, but their low specific capacity creates a long-term problem. The lower reactivity of magnesium makes pure Mg metal anodes much safer than alkali ones. However, these are still reactive enough to be deactivated over time. Alloying magnesium with different metals can solve this problem. Combining this with different cathodes gives good specific capacities, but with a lower voltage (&lt;1.3 V, compared with 3.8 V for Li-ion batteries). Zinc has the lowest theoretical specific capacity, but zinc metal anodes are so stable that they can be used without alterations. This results in comparable capacities to the other materials and can be immediately used in systems where weight is not a problem. Theoretically, aluminum is the most promising alternative, with its high specific capacity thanks to its three-electron redox reaction. However, the trade-off between stability and specific capacity is a problem. After analyzing each option separately, we compare them all via a political, economic, socio-cultural and technological (PEST) analysis. The review concludes with recommendations for future applications in the mobile and stationary power sectors.">

The flexible porous nanosheets in the three-dimensional flower-like nanostructure provide facile strain relaxation to avoid stress concentration during the volume changes. Rich sulfur vacancies and porous structure enable the fast and efficient electron transport. The porous SnS2-x microflowers exhibit outstanding performance for lithium ion battery in terms of high capacity (1375 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1) and outstanding rate capability (827 mA h g-1 at high rate of 2 A g-1). For sodium ion battery, a high capacity (~522 mAh g-1) can be achieved at 5 A g-1 after 200 cycles for SnS2-x microflowers.

In order to solve this problem, we use a cage like microporous MOF(CPM-5) as a carbon source, which is carbonized at high temperature to get a micro-mesoporous carbon composite material. In addition, indium oxide particles formed during carbonization are deposited on CPM-5 structure, forming a simple core-shell structure CPM-5-C-600. When it is used as the cathode of Li-S battery, the small molecule sulfide can be confined in the micropores, while the existence of large pore size mesopores can provide a channel for the transmission of lithium ions, so as to improve the conductivity of the material and the rate performance of the battery. After 100 cycles, the specific capacity of the battery can be still maintained at 650 mA h·g-1 and the Coulombic efficiency is close to 100%.

By contrast with the prevailing methods of blending preformed ceramic fillers within the polymer matrix, here we proposed an in situ synthesis method of SiO2 nanoparticles in the PEO matrix. In this case, robust chemical interactions between SiO2 nanoparticles, lithium salt and PEO chains were induced by the in situ non-hydrolytic sol gel process. The in situ synthesized nanocomposite polymer electrolyte delivered an impressive ionic conductivity of ~1.1 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 30 °C, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the preformed synthesized composite polymer electrolyte. In addition, an extended electrochemical window of up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+ was achieved. The Li/nanocomposite polymer electrolyte/Li symmetric cell demonstrated a stable long-term cycling performance of over 700 h at 0.01-0.1 mA cm-2 without short circuiting. The all-solid-state battery consisting of the nanocomposite polymer electrolyte, Li metal and LiFePO4 provides a discharge capacity of 123.5 mAh g-1, a Coulombic efficiency above 99% and a good capacity retention of 70% after 100 cycles.">

It is found that the cell performance of a coated separator using aqueous slurry (WPS) is better than that of the coated separator using acetone (APS) as the solvent. The separator with flat and pyknotic surface (PP and APS) has a strong polar action with the electrolyte, where the polar part is more than 80%. To the contrary, the WPS has a roughness surface and when the PVDF-HFP particles accumulate loose, it makes the apolar part plays a dominate role in surface free energy; the dispersive energy reaches to 40.17 mJ m-2. The WPS has the lowest immersion free energy, 31.9 mJ m-2 with the electrolyte, and this will accelerate electrolyte infiltration to the separator. The loose particle accumulation also increases the electrolyte weight uptake and interfacial wettability velocity, which plays a crucial role in improving the cell performance such as the ionic conductivity, discharge capacity and the C-rate capability.">

Studies in this area have mainly focused on nanostructured electrodes synthesized by graphene oxide (GO) or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and surface modifications by a chemical treatment. Herein, we propose a cost-effective and reliable route for generating a defect-free, nanoporous graphene nanostructure (df-GNS) through the sequential insertion of pyridine into a potassium graphite intercalation compound (K-GIC). The as-prepared df-GNS preserves the intrinsic property of graphene without any crystal damage, leading to micro-/nano-porosity (microporosity: ~10-50 µm, nanoporosity: ~2-20 nm) with a significantly large specific surface area. The electrochemical performance of the df-GNS as an anode electrode was assessed and showed a notably enhanced capacity, rate capability, and cycle stability, without fading in capacity or decaying. This is because of the optimal porosity, with perfect preservation of the graphene crystal, allowing faster ion access and a high amount of electron pathways onto the electrode. Therefore, our work will be very helpful for the development of anode and cathode electrodes with higher energy and power performance requirements.">

Its operation involves a quinone/hydroquinone redox reaction on anode and a MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction on cathode, in parallel with the transfer of H3O+ between two electrodes. The distinct operation mechanism affords this hydronium-ion battery an energy density up to 132.6 Wh kg-1 and a supercapacitor-comparable power density of 30.8 kW kg-1, along with a long-term cycling life over 5000 cycles.

Nevertheless, for reasons discussed herein the synthesis of a polymer electrolyte that simultaneously has a shear modulus of G' ≈ GPa and an ion conductivity of σ &gt; 10-4 S/cm (in the case dual ion conductor) or of σ &gt; 10-5 S/cm (in the case of single-ion conductor) remains a challenge.

The surface composition of the pre-doped silicon particles was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), solid state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Pressurization promoted SEI growth and lithium binding with silicon to form Li15Si4 accompanied by the reductive reaction product of Li2CO3 originated from electrolyte.

In this study submicron Li6.6La3Zr1.6Nb0.4O12 (LLZNO) powder-which has a stable cubic phase and high sintering activity-was prepared using the conventional solid-state reaction and the attrition milling process, and Li stoichiometric LLZNO ceramics were obtained by sintering this powder-which is difficult to control under high sintering temperatures and when sintered for a long time-at a relatively low temperature or for a short amount of time. The particle-size distribution, phase structure, microstructure, distribution of elements, total ionic conductivity, relative density, and activation energy of the submicron LLZNO powder and the LLZNO ceramics were tested and analyzed using laser diffraction particle-size analyzer (LD), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and the Archimedean method. The total ionic conductivity of samples sintered at 1200 °C for 30 min was 5.09 × 10-4 S·cm-1, the activation energy was 0.311 eV, and the relative density was 87.3%. When the samples were sintered at 1150 °C for 60 min the total ionic conductivity was 3.49 × 10-4 S·cm-1, the activation energy was 0.316 eV, and the relative density was 90.4%. At the same time, quasi-solid-state batteries were assembled with LiMn2O4 as the positive electrode and submicron LLZNO powder as the solid-state electrolyte. After 50 cycles, the discharge specific capacity was 105.5 mAh/g and the columbic efficiency was above 95%.">

This trend will continue owing to the growing interest of consumers for electric vehicles, recent engagement of car manufacturers to produce them, recent developments in energy storage facilities, and commitment of governments for the electrification of transportation. Although some limited recycling processes were developed earlier after the commercialization of LIBs, these are inadequate in the context of sustainable development. Therefore, significant efforts have been made to replace the commonly employed pyrometallurgical recycling method with a less detrimental approach, such as hydrometallurgical, in particular sulfate-based leaching, or direct recycling. Sulfate-based leaching is the only large-scale hydrometallurgical method currently used for recycling LIBs and serves as baseline for several pilot or demonstration projects currently under development. Conversely, most project and processes focus only on the recovery of Ni, Co, Mn, and less Li, and are wasting the iron phosphate originating from lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Although this battery type does not dominate the LIB market, its presence in the waste stream of LIBs causes some technical concerns that affect the profitability of current recycling processes. This review explores the current processes and alternative solutions to pyrometallurgy, including novel selective leaching processes or direct recycling approaches.">

Low-cost natural cellulose fibers with a 2-mm length are employed as binder and support for the electrode. The objective of this method is to eliminate the use of heavy and inactive current collector foils as substrates and to replace conventional costly binders with cellulose fibers. Moreover, no harmful solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone, are employed for film fabrication. Water-soluble carbons are also utilized to reduce the preparation time and to achieve a better repartition of carbon in the electrode, thus improving the electrochemical performance. Flexible and resistant LiFePO4 (LFP), Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), and graphite electrodes are obtained with active mass loadings similar to those obtained by the current casting method. The initial discharge capacity of approximately 130 mAh·g-1 at 2 C is obtained for an LFP/LTO paper battery with an approximately 91.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

        <span class="abst" title="Although the successful deployment of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in various fields such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles and electric grid, the efforts are still ongoing to pursue the next-generation battery systems with higher energy densities. Interest has been increasing in the batteries relying on the multivalent-ions such as Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+, because of the higher volumetric energy densities than those of monovalent-ion batteries including LIBs and Na-ion batteries. Among them, magnesium batteries have attracted much attention due to the promising characteristics of Mg anode: a low redox potential (-2.356 V vs. SHE), a high volumetric energy density (3,833 mAh cm-3), atmospheric stability and the earth-abundance. However, the development of Mg batteries has progressed little since the first Mg-ion rechargeable battery was reported in 2000. A severe technological bottleneck concerns the organic electrolytes, which have limited compatibility with Mg anode and form an Mg-ion insulating passivation layer on the anode surface. Consequently, beneficial to the good chemical and mechanical stability, Mg-ion solid electrolyte should be a promising alternative to the liquid electrolyte. Herein, a mini review is presented to focus on the recent development of Mg-ion solid conductor. The performances and the limitations were also discussed in the review. We hope that the mini review could provide a quick grasp of the challenges in the area and inspire researchers to develop applicable solid electrolyte candidates for Mg batteries.">

One-step microwave heating can simplify the reduction step of graphene oxide and provide a convenient, economical, and effective method of preparing graphene composites. The structural analysis shows that LiFePO4/graphene has high phase purity and crystallinity. The morphological analysis shows that LiFePO4/graphene microspheres and micron blocks are composed of densely aggregated nanoparticles; the nanoparticle size can shorten the diffusion path of lithium ions and thus increase the lithium-ion diffusion rate. Additionally, the graphene sheets can provide a rapid transport path for electrons, thus increasing the electronic conductivity of the material. Furthermore, the nanoparticles being packed into the micron graphene sheets can ensure stability in the electrolyte during charging and discharging. Raman analysis reveals that the graphene has a high degree of graphitization. Electrochemical analysis shows that the LiFePO4/graphene has an excellent capacity, high rate performance, and cycle stability. The discharge capacities are 166.3, 156.1, 143.0, 132.4, and 120.9 mAh g-1 at rates of 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 C, respectively. The superior electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the synergy of the shorter lithium-ion diffusion path achieved by LiFePO4 nanoparticles and the conductive networks of graphene.">

However, there are many challenges to overcome before the practical application of SCEs, including the low ionic conductivity less than 10-3 S cm-1 at ambient temperature, poor interfacial stability, and high interfacial resistance, which greatly restrict the room temperature performance. Herein, the advances of SCEs applied in all-solid-state lithium batteries are presented, including the Li ion migration mechanism of SCEs, the strategies to enhance the ionic conductivity of SCEs by various morphologies of ICEs, and construction methods of the low resistance and stable interfaces of SCEs with both cathode and anode. Finally, some typical applications of SCEs in lithium batteries are summarized and future development directions are prospected. This work presents how it is quite significant to further enhance the ionic conductivity of SCEs by developing the novel SPEs with the special morphology of ICEs for advanced all-solid-state lithium batteries.">

Sodium (Na) metal-based batteries can be a possible alternative to lithium-based batteries due to the similar electrochemical voltage of Na and Li together with the thousand times higher natural abundance of Na compared to Li. Though two different kinds of Na-O2 batteries have been studied specifically based on electrolytes until now, very recently, a hybrid Na-air cell has shown distinctive advantage over nonaqueous cell systems. Hybrid Na-air batteries provide a fundamental advantage due to the formation of highly soluble discharge product (sodium hydroxide) which leads to low overpotentials for charge and discharge processes, high electrical energy efficiency, and good cyclic stability. Herein, the current status and challenges associated with hybrid Na-air batteries are reported. Also, a brief description of nonaqueous Na-O2 batteries and its close competition with hybrid Na-air batteries are provided.">

Understanding the electrode reaction of lithium-ion batteries is the key to improve their cycle life and safety. Direct measurement of thermodynamic data of the electrode reaction is a practical, economical, and nondestructive method for electrode characterization. In this paper, the open-circuit voltage of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell is measured at different discharge states and different temperatures. The dE/dT-SOD (state of discharge) relation curves are fitted linearly by the least square method, and the entropy change values of different SODs are calculated. Finally, the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy change of different SODs are obtained. The electrode reaction of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 in different SODs was discussed by the entropy change in different SODs. According to the evolution trend of ΔS, the lithium intercalation reaction of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 may be a single-phase solid solution reaction rather than a two-phase reaction. Finally, the reversible heat generation at different current values and SODs are calculated.">

However, the aggregation of graphene and the weak interaction between the two components hinder their practical application. Inspired by the sandwich structure, novel three-dimensional flower-like MoS2-PrGO sandwich composites were proposed as an advanced anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The separated 2D ultrathin rGO nano-sheets were connected by PEO chains and assembled into a well-organized 3D layered spatial structure, which not only avoids the aggregation of graphene but also accommodates a high mass loading of the micro-scale MoS2 nano-flowers. MoS2 nano-flowers with open architecture deliver large specific area. The rGO interlayers act as a conductive framework, making all flower-like MoS2 nano-stuffing electrochemically active. The ultra-thin 2D nano-sheets provide excellent cycle stability due to their neglectable volume changes during cycling. The 3D flower-like MoS2-PrGO sandwich composites deliver high energy density, excellent conductivity and stable cyclic performance during charge-discharge process. With a nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, their reversible capacity is retained at 1,036 mA h g-1 even after 500 cycles at current densities of 100 mA g-1. This novel design strategy provides a broad prospect for the development of advanced anode materials for superior lithium storage.">

Also, the calculated voltage profiles agree satisfactorily with experiment both for full (Li-ion battery) and partial (Na-ion battery) discharge, even though experimental atomistic knowledge is missing up to now. Moreover, we rationalize the structural preference of intermediate ternaries and their characteristic lowering in the voltage profile using chemical-bonding and Mulliken-charge analysis. The formation of such ternary intermediates for the lithiation of FeNCN and the contribution of at least one ternary intermediate is also confirmed experimentally.

A cobalt-modified δ-MnO2 with a redox-active surface shows superior self-recovery capability as a cathode. The cobalt-containing species in the cathode enable efficient self-recovery by continuously catalyzing the electrochemical deposition of active Mn compound, which is confirmed by characterizations of both practical coin-type batteries and a new-design electrolyzer system. Under optimized condition, a high specific capacity over 500 mAh g-1 is achieved, together with a decent cycling performance with a retention rate of 63% over 5,000 cycles.

        <span class="abst" title="Commercial micrometer silicon (Si) powder was investigated as a potential anode material for lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries. The characterization of this powder showed the mean particle size of approx.75.2 nm, BET surface area of 10.6 m2/g and average pore size of 0.56 nm. Its band gap was estimated to 1.35 eV as determined using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra. In order to increase the surface area and porosity which is important for Li-ion batteries, the starting Si powder was ball-milled and threatened by metal-assisted chemical etching. The mechanochemical treatment resulted in decrease of the particle size from 75 nm to 29 nm, an increase of the BET surface area and average pore size to 16.7 m2/g and 1.26 nm, respectively, and broadening of the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) lines. The XRD patterns of silver metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) sample showed strong and narrow diffraction lines typical for powder silicon and low-intensity diffraction lines typical for silver. The metal-assisted chemical etching of starting Si material resulted in a decrease of surface area to 7.3 m2/g and an increase of the average pore size to 3.44 nm. These three materials were used as the anode material in lithium-ion cells, and their electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the sample prepared by MACE is attributed to increase in pore size, which are large enough for easy lithiation. These are the positive aspects of the application of MACE in the development of an anode material for Li-ion batteries.">

        <span class="abst" title="Transition metal oxide is one of the most promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Generally, the electrochemical property of transition metal oxides can be improved by optimizing their element components and controlling their nano-architecture. Herein, we designed nonstoichiometric Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires for high performance lithium-ion storage. It is found that the specific capacity of Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires remain 880 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles, exhibiting much better electrochemical performance than CuCo2O4 and NiCo2O4. After experiencing a large current charge and discharge state, the discharge capacity of Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires recovers to 780 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, which is ca. 88% of the initial capacity. The high electrochemical performance of Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires is related to their better electronic conductivity and synergistic effect of metals. This work may provide a new strategy for the design of multicomponent transition metal oxides as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.">

        <span class="abst" title="As lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode materials, porous carbons with high specific surface area are highly required because they can well accommodate huge volume expansion/contraction during cycling. In this work, hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) with high specific surface area (~1714.83 m2 g-1) is synthesized from biomass reed flowers. The material presents good cycling stability as an LIB anode, delivering an excellent reversible capacity of 581.2 mAh g-1 after cycling for 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1, and still remains a reversible capacity of 298.5 mAh g-1 after cycling for 1000 cycles even at 1000 mA g-1. The good electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the high specific surface area of the HPC network, which provides rich and fast paths for electron and ion transfer and provides large contact area and mutual interactions between the electrolyte and active materials. The work proposes a new route for the preparation of low cost carbon-based anodes and may promote the development of other porous carbon materials derived from various biomass carbon sources.">

        <span class="abst" title="Boosted power handling and the reduced charging duration of Li ion cells critically rests with ionic/electronic mobility. Ion mobility in electrochemically relevant grains normally stands for an essential restriction of the velocity at which the energy of a cell can be stored/released. To offset sluggish solid-state ionic transport and achieve a superior power/energy density rating, electroactive grains often need exquisite nanoscaling, harming crucial virtues on volumetric packing density, tractability, sustainability, durability, and cost. Unlike elaborate nanostructuring, here we describe that a SnO2-Fe2O3@carbon composite-which adopts a metal oxide particles-intercalated bulk-like configuration-can insert many Li+ ions at elevated speeds, despite its micro-dimensionality. Analysis of charge transport kinetics in this tailor-made architecture unveils both much improved ion travel through compact monolithic substances and the greatly enhanced ion access to surfaces of SnO2/Fe2O3 grains. According to the well-studied battery degradation mechanism, it is that both the effective stress management and internal electric field in our as-prepared sample that result in recommendable capacity, rate behavior, and cyclic lifespan (exhibiting a high reversible capacity of 927 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 95.1% after 100 cycles and an ultra-stable capacity of 429 mAh g-1 even over 1800 cycles at 3 A g-1). Unique materials and working rationale which ensure the swift (de)lithiation of such micrometer-dimensional monoliths may open a door for various high-power/density usages.">

In this work, we prepared a composite membrane using PVdF-SiO2 via phase inversion method. This work was systematically studied towards the morphology, porosity, and electrochemical properties of as prepared membrane. The electrolyte uptake capability of separator membrane tested with 1 M NaPF6 electrolyte solution and temperature-dependent ionic conduction test were performed at various temperatures.

The LiB skeleton exhibits superior lithiophilic and conductive characteristics, which contributes to the reduction of the local current density and homogenization of incoming Li+ flux. With the introduction of Mg, the composite achieves an ultralong lithium deposition/dissolution lifespan (500 h, at 0.5 mA cm-2) without short circuit in the symmetrical battery. In addition, the electrochemical performance is superior in full batteries assembled with LiCoO2 cathode and the manufactured composite. The currently proposed 3D Li-B-Mg composite anode may significantly propel the advancement of LMB technology from laboratory research to industrial commercialization.">
