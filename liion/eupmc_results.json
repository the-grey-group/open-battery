      "Because of flexibility, compactness, weavability, and ergonomic design, yarn-shaped lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have enormous potential applications in wearable electronics. Still, the yarn-shaped LIB with the ability to meet commercialization requirements has never been reported, owing to the current challenge in complex material synthesis technologies, expensive raw material costs, poor safety performance, and nonstandard manufacturing equipment. Herein, we propose a yarn-shaped LIB that meets the aforementioned requirements. With a highly conductive and flexible stainless-steel yarn acting as the current collector, the electrode active materials and the gel electrolyte, which are commercially available at low cost, are uniformly coated onto the stainless-steel yarn by a simple and facile dipping-drying method. Even at different deformation conditions (i.e., bending or knotting), the specific capacity of the yarn-shaped LIB (7 cm long, <2 mm in diameter) assembled from graphite and lithium iron phosphate electrodes is maintained >85%. After charged treatment, it can successfully power up an electronic watch and an electronic thermo-hygrometer. Thanks to the simple preparation process, low cost of raw materials, and good safety performance, this work can promote the commercialization of wearable energy storage devices."

      "Currently, lithium-ion batteries are widely used as energy storage systems for mobile applications. However, a better understanding of their nature is still required to improve battery management systems (BMS). Overvoltages and open-circuit voltage (OCV) hysteresis provide valuable information regarding battery performance, but estimations of these parameters are generally inaccurate, leading to errors in BMS. Studies on hysteresis are commonly avoided because the hysteresis depends on the state of charge and degradation level and requires time-consuming measurements. We have investigated hysteresis and overvoltages in Li(NiMnCo)O2/graphite and LiFePO4/graphite commercial cells. Here we report a direct relationship between an increase in OCV hysteresis and an increase in charge overvoltage when the cells are degraded by cycling. We find that the hysteresis is related to diffusion and increases with the formation of pure phases, being primarily related to the graphite electrode. These findings indicate that the graphite electrode is a determining factor for cell efficiency."

      "Temperature rise in Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to solid electrolyte interfaces breakdown, uncontrollable exothermic reactions in electrodes and Joule heating can result in the catastrophic failures such as thermal runaway, which is calling for reliable real-time electrode temperature monitoring. Here, we present a customized LIB setup developed for early detection of electrode temperature rise during simulated thermal runaway tests incorporating a modern additive manufacturing-supported resistance temperature detector (RTD). An advanced RTD is embedded in a 3D printed polymeric substrate and placed behind the electrode current collector of CR2032 coin cells that can sustain harsh electrochemical operational environments (acidic electrolyte without Redox, short-circuiting, leakage etc.) without participating in electrochemical reactions. The internal RTD measured an average 5.8 °C higher temperature inside the cells than the external RTD with almost 10 times faster detection ability, prohibiting thermal runaway events without interfering in the LIBs' operation. A temperature prediction model is developed to forecast battery surface temperature rise stemming from measured internal and external RTD temperature signatures."

      "Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) has received increasing attention as an alternative manufacturing approach to slurry casting for the production of battery and supercapacitor electrodes. This process is of relevance for industrial scalability as evidently seen in the current electrophoretic paints industry. Nevertheless, the reported work so far have only concentrated on thin films of electrophoretically deposited electrodes for energy storage. Here, the electrochemical performance of thick films (up to tens of μm) as lithium-ion battery electrodes produced by EPD is reported. A commercially sourced LiN1/3M1/3C1/3O2 (5 to 25 μm particle size) was used in this exemplary investigation. This work shows the production of binder-free high density active material (>90 %) electrodes. Coin cells were assembled and the battery performance was measured. Tests included: cyclic voltammetry, C-rate vs capacity, battery cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Other investigations also studied: colloidal electrolyte formulation, electrode manufacture, microstructure characterisation and elemental mapping analysis. In short, EPD electrode manufacture can be applied as a platform technology for any battery and supercapacitor material, and the reported manufacturing processes and methodologies represent direct relevance to produce energy storage electrodes useful to practical applications."

      "Silicon can be used in a variety of applications. Particularly, silicon particles are attracting increased attention as energy storage materials for lithium-ion batteries. However, silicon has a limited cycling performance owing to its peeling from the current collector and the volume expansion that occurs during alloying with lithium in the charging process. Significant contributors to this problem are the even distribution of silicon nanoparticles within the carbon matrix and their deep placement in the internal structure. In this study, we synthesized silicon nanoparticles and carbon materials via a bottom-up approach using a new method called plasma in solution. Silicon nanoparticles and the carbon matrix were synthesized in a structure similar to carbon black. It was confirmed that the silicon particles were evenly distributed in the carbon matrix. In addition, the evaluation of the electrochemical performance of the silicon-carbon matrix (Si-C) composite material showed that it exhibited stable cycling performance with high reversible capacity."

      "The intelligence to synchronously identify multiple spectral signatures in a lithium-ion battery electrode (LIB) would facilitate the usage of analytical technique for inline quality control and product development. Here, we present an analytical framework (AF) to automatically identify the existing spectral signatures in the hyperspectral Raman dataset of LIB electrodes. The AF is entirely automated and requires fewer or almost no human assistance. The end-to-end pipeline of AF own the following features; (i) intelligently pre-processing the hyperspectral Raman dataset to eliminate the cosmic noise and baseline, (ii) extract all the reliable spectral signatures from the hyperspectral dataset and assign the class labels, (iii) training a neural network (NN) on to the precisely \"labelled\" spectral signature, and finally, examined the interoperability/reusability of already trained NN on to the newly measured dataset taken from the same LIB specimen or completely different LIB specimen for inline real-time analytics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to quantitatively assess the capacity degradation of LIB via a capacity retention coefficient that can be calculated by comparing the LMO signatures extracted by the analytical framework (AF). The present approach is suited for real-time vibrational spectroscopy based industrial applications; multicomponent chemical reactions, chromatographic, spectroscopic mixtures, and environmental monitoring."

      "Designing a composite separator that can withstand high temperature, deliver high capacity, and offer fast charge-discharge capability is imperative for developing a high-performance lithium-ion battery. Here, a series of ceramic nanoparticle-coated nanofiber membranes, including Al2O3/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), SiO2/PVDF, and Al2O3/SiO2/PVDF, were prepared by melt-electrospinning and magnetron sputtering deposition. Among all of these composite separators, Al2O3/SiO2/PVDF showed several advantages including excellent thermal stability (no dimensional shrinkage at temperature up to 130 °C and an onset degradation temperature of 445 °C) and superb electrolyte compatibility (340% electrolyte uptake). In addition, the β phase of the fibrous PVDF membrane as well as the presence of polar ceramic nanoparticles on the fiber surface can synergistically improve the ion conductivity to 2.055 mS/cm at room temperature, which is more than 8 times higher than that of the commercial polyethylene (PE) separator. Performance of these ceramic nanoparticle-coated separators in a lithium-ion battery demonstrated an improved discharge capacity of 161.5 mAh/g and more than 84.3% capacity retention rate after 100 cycles. The ceramic nanoparticle-coated PVDF separators also maintained 58.4% capacity at a high current density of 8C, which is better than the 49.8% capacity for the commercial PE separator. Therefore, the ceramic nanoparticle-coated PVDF membrane proves to be a promising separator for a high-power and more secure lithium-ion battery."

      "Considering the sharp increase in energy demand, Si-based composites have shown promise as high-performance anodes for lithium-ion batteries during the last few years. However, a significant volume change of Si during repetitive cycles may cause technical and security problems that limit the particular application. Here, an optimized reduced graphene oxide/silicon (RGO/Si) composite with excellent stability has been fabricated via a facile templated self-assembly strategy. The active silicon nanoparticles were uniformly supported by graphene that can further form a three-dimensional network to buffer the volume change of Si and produce a stable solid-electrolyte interphase film due to the increased specific surface area and enhanced intermolecular interaction, resulting in an increase of electrical conductivity and structural stability. As the anode electrode material of lithium-ion batteries, the optimized 10RGO/Si-600 composite showed a reversible high capacity of 2317 mA h/g with an initial efficiency of 93.2% and a quite high capacity retention of 85% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A/g rate. Especially, it still displayed a specific capacity of 728 mA h/g after 100 cycles at a reasonably high current density of 2 A/g. This study has proposed the optimized method for developing advanced graphene/Si nanocomposites for enhanced cycling stability lithium-ion batteries."

      "We fabricated tin phosphide-carbon (Sn4P3/C) composite film by aerosol deposition (AD) and investigated its electrochemical performance for a lithium-ion battery anode. Sn4P3/C composite powders prepared by a ball milling was used as raw material and deposited onto a stainless steel substrate to form the composite film via impact consolidation. The Sn4P3/C composite film fabricated by AD showed much better electrochemical performance than the Sn4P3 film without complexing carbon. Although both films showed initial discharge (Li+ extraction) capacities of approximately 1000 mAh g-1, Sn4P3/C films retained higher reversible capacity above 700 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles of charge and discharge processes while the capacity of Sn4P3 film rapidly degraded with cycling. In addition, by controlling the potential window in galvanostatic testing, Sn4P3/C composite film retained the reversible capacity of 380 mAh g-1 even after 400 cycles. The complexed carbon works not only as a buffer to suppress the collapse of electrodes by large volume change of Sn4P3 in charge and discharge reactions but also as an electronic conduction path among the atomized active material particles in the film."

      "Historically long accepted to be the singular root cause of capacity fading, transition metal dissolution has been reported to severely degrade the anode. However, its impact on the cathode behavior remains poorly understood. Here we show the correlation between capacity fading and phase/surface stability of an LiMn2O4 cathode. It is revealed that a combination of structural transformation and transition metal dissolution dominates the cathode capacity fading. LiMn2O4 exhibits irreversible phase transitions driven by manganese(III) disproportionation and Jahn-Teller distortion, which in conjunction with particle cracks results in serious manganese dissolution. Meanwhile, fast manganese dissolution in turn triggers irreversible structural evolution, and as such, forms a detrimental cycle constantly consuming active cathode components. Furthermore, lithium-rich LiMn2O4 with lithium/manganese disorder and surface reconstruction could effectively suppress the irreversible phase transition and manganese dissolution. These findings close the loop of understanding capacity fading mechanisms and allow for development of longer life batteries."

      "As an important component, the anode determines the property and development of lithium ion batteries. The synthetic method and the structure design of the negative electrode materials play decisive roles in improving the property of the thus-assembled batteries. Si@C compound materials have been widely used based on their excellent lithium ion intercalation capacity and cyclic stability, in which the in-situ synthetic method can make full use of the structural advantages of the monomer itself, thus improving the electrochemical performance of the anode material. In this paper, the different preparation technologies and composite structures of Si@C compound materials by in-situ synthesis are introduced. The research progress of Si@C compound materials by in-situ synthesis is reviewed, and the prospect of future development of Si@C compound materials has been tentatively commented."

      "We report synchrotron-based operando soft X-ray microscopic photoelectron spectroscopy under charge-discharge control of single crystalline LiCoO2 (LCO) particles as an active electrode material for an all solid-state lithium-ion battery (LIB). Photoelectron mapping and the photoelectron spectrum of a selected microscopic region are obtained by a customized operando cell for LIBs. During the charge process, a more effective Li extraction from a side facet of the single crystalline LCO particle than from the central part is observed, which ensures the reliability of the system as an operando microscopic photoelectron analyzer that can track changes in the electronic structure of a selected part of the active particle. Based on these assessments, the no drastic change in the Co 2p XPS spectra during charge-discharge of LCO supports that the charge-polarization may occur at the oxygen side by strong hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p orbitals. The success of tracking the electronic-structure change at each facet of a single crystalline electrode material during charge-discharge is a major step toward the fabrication of innovative active electrode materials for LIBs."

      "A simple method is developed for the preparation of MoSe2/MoO2 composite with a flower-like structure for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). MoSe2 could lead to fast and facile movement of Li+ due to its larger interlayer spacing. Meanwhile, MoO2 could protect the lamellar structure of MoSe2 from being destroyed in the charging/discharging processes to maintain the required active surface to electrolytes. In addition, the flower-like structure of the composite could effectively alleviate the volume expansion during charging/discharging. As LIBs are anode material, MoSe2/MoO2 composite demonstrates an excellent specific discharge capacity of 1042 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g-1, which is attributed to the synergistic effects of MoSe2 and MoO2 in the composite."

      "The calcination temperature plays a significant role in the structural, textural, and energy-storage performance of metal oxide nanomaterials in Li-ion battery application. Here, we report the formation of well-crystallized homogeneously dispersed Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 hollow nano/sub-microsphere architectures through a simple cost-effective coprecipitation and chemical mixing route without surface modification for improving the efficiency of energy storage devices. The synthesized Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 hollow nano/sub-microsphere cathode materials are calcined at 800, 900, 950, and 1000 °C. Among them, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 calcined at 950 °C exhibits a high discharge capacity (277 mAh g-1 at 0.1C rate) and excellent capacity retention (88%) after 50 cycles and also delivers an excellent discharge capacity of >172 mAh g-1 at 5C rate. Good electrochemical performance of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2-950 is directly related to the optimized size of its primary particles (85 nm) (which constitute the spherical secondary particle, ∼720 nm) and homogeneous cation mixing. Higher calcination temperature (≥950 °C) leads to an increase of the primary particle size, poor cycling stability, and inferior rate capacity of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 due to smashing of quasi-hollow spheres upon repeated lithium ion intercalations/deintercalations. Therefore, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2-950 is a promising electrode for the next-generation high-voltage and high-capacity Li-ion battery application."

      "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are considered to be one of the most important energy storage technologies. As the energy density of batteries increases, battery safety becomes even more critical if the energy is released unintentionally. Accidents related to fires and explosions of LIBs occur frequently worldwide. Some have caused serious threats to human life and health and have led to numerous product recalls by manufacturers. These incidents are reminders that safety is a prerequisite for batteries, and serious issues need to be resolved before the future application of high-energy battery systems. This Review aims to summarize the fundamentals of the origins of LIB safety issues and highlight recent key progress in materials design to improve LIB safety. We anticipate that this Review will inspire further improvement in battery safety, especially for emerging LIBs with high-energy density."

      "BACKGROUND:Li-ion batteries (LIB) are increasingly used worldwide. They are made of low solubility micrometric particles, implying a potential for inhalation toxicity in occupational settings and possibly for consumers. LiCoO2 (LCO), one of the most used cathode material, induces inflammatory and fibrotic lung responses in mice. LCO also stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) -1α, a factor implicated in inflammation, fibrosis and carcinogenicity. Here, we investigated the role of cobalt, nickel and HIF-1α as determinants of toxicity, and evaluated their predictive value for the lung toxicity of LIB particles in in vitro assays. RESULTS:By testing a set of 5 selected LIB particles (LCO, LiNiMnCoO2, LiNiCoAlO2) with different cobalt and nickel contents, we found a positive correlation between their in vivo lung inflammatory activity, and (i) Co and Ni particle content and their bioaccessibility and (ii) the stabilization of HIF-1α in the lung. Inhibition of HIF-1α with chetomin or PX-478 blunted the lung inflammatory response to LCO in mice. In IL-1β deficient mice, HIF-1α was the upstream signal of the inflammatory lung response to LCO. In vitro, the level of HIF-1α stabilization induced by LIB particles in BEAS-2B cells correlated with the intensity of lung inflammation induced by the same particles in vivo. CONCLUSIONS:We conclude that HIF-1α, stabilized in lung cells by released Co and Ni ions, is a mechanism-based biomarker of lung inflammatory responses induced by LIB particles containing Co/Ni. Documenting the Co/Ni content of LIB particles, their bioaccessibility and their capacity to stabilize HIF-1α in vitro can be used to predict the lung inflammatory potential of LIB particles."

      "Rapidly-growing demand for wearable and flexible devices is boosting the development of flexible lithium ion batteries (LIBs). The exploitation of flexible electrodes with high mechanical properties and superior electrochemical performances has been a key challenge for the rapid practical application of flexible LIBs. Herein, a flexible composite electrode was prepared from the mixed solutions of Li[Li0.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54]O2 (LLOs), carbon nanotubes(CNTs), and nanofibrillated celluloses (NFCs) via a vacuum filtration method. The resulting LLOs/CNTs/NFCs electrode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 253 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C in the voltage range from 2.0 to 4.6 V, and retained a reversible capacity of 178 mAh g-1 with 83% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C. The LLOs/CNTs/NFCs electrode exhibited excellent flexibility along with repeated bending in the bending test. The LLOs/CNTs/NFCs electrode after bending test remained a discharge capacity of 149 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at 1 C, and the corresponding capacity retentions was 76%. The excellent electrochemical performance and high flexibility can be ascribed to the framework formed by CNTs with high conductivity and NFCs with good mechanical properties. The results imply that the as-fabricated electrode can be a promising candidate for the flexible LIBs."

      "Nickel⁻manganese⁻cobalt oxides, with LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O₂ (NMC) as the most prominent compound, are state-of-the-art cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. The growing market for electro mobility has led to a growing global demand for Li, Co, Ni, and Mn, making spent lithium-ion batteries a valuable secondary resource. Going forward, energy- and resource-inefficient pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical recycling strategies must be avoided. We presented an approach to recover NMC particles from spent lithium-ion battery cathodes while preserving their chemical and morphological properties, with a minimal use of chemicals. The key task was the separation of the cathode coating layer consisting of NMC, an organic binder, and carbon black, from the Al substrate foil. This can be performed in water under strong agitation to support the slow detachment process. However, the contact of the NMC cathode with water leads to a release of Li⁺ ions and a fast increase in the pH. Unwanted side reactions may occur as the Al substrate foil starts to dissolve and Al(OH)₃ precipitates on the NMC. These side reactions are avoided using pH-adjusted solutions with sufficiently high buffer capacities to separate the coating layer from the Al substrate, without precipitations and without degradation of the NMC particles."

      "Lithium-ion batteries are widely used as basic power supplies and storage units for large-scale electric drive products such as electric vehicles. Their reliability is directly related to the life and safe operation of the electric drive products. In fact, the cells have a dependent relationship with the degradation process and they affect the degradation rate of the entire battery pack, thereby affecting its reliability. At present, most research focuses on the reliability of battery packs and assumes that their cells are independent of each other, which may cause the reliability of the evaluation to deviate greatly from the actual level. In order to accurately assess the reliability of lithium-ion batteries, it is necessary to build a reliability model considering the dependency among cells for the overall degradation of lithium-ion battery packs. Therefore, in this study, based on a lithium-ion battery degradation test, the Wiener process is used to analyze the reliability of four basic configurations of lithium-ion battery packs. According to the degradation data of the battery packs, the Copula function is used to quantitatively describe the dependent relationship in the degradation process of a single battery, and the quantitative dependent relationship is combined with the reliability model to form a new reliability model. Finally, taking the battery system of Tesla S as an example, a feasible optimization method for battery pack design is provided based on the model constructed in this work."

      "Red phosphorus (RP) has attracted extensive attention as an anodic material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high theoretical specific capacity of 2596 mA h g- 1 and earth abundance. However, the facile and large-scale preparation of the red phosphorus nanomaterials via a solution synthesis remains a challenge. Herein, we develop a simple and facile solution method to prepare red phosphorus nanoparticles (RP NPs). PCl3 readily reacts with HSiCl3 in the presence of amines at room temperature to produce amorphous RP NPs with sizes about 100-200 nm in high yields. When used as an anode for rechargeable lithium ion battery, the RP NP electrode exhibits good electrochemical performance with a reversible capacity of 1380 mA h g- 1 after 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g- 1, and Coulombic efficiencies reaching almost 100% for each cycle. The study shows that this solution synthesis is a facile and convenient approach for large-scale production of RP NP materials for use in high-performance Li-ion batteries."

      "High electrolyte wettability, thermal dimensional stability, and tensile strength are prerequisites for implementing separators in practical applications. In this study, we report on the discovery of nanofibril membranes derived from various plant fibers commonly used in the papermaking industry, for low cost and higher performances than the commercially available Celgard2325 in regard to the application of separators for lithium-ion batteries. Nanofibril membranes showed water contact angles as low as 18°, negligible size change at a heating temperature of 160 °C for 120 min, and tensile strength up to 137.6 MPa. The homogenization was found to strongly contribute to these improved performances. These findings suggest that the plant fiber-derived nanofibril membranes are anticipated to be promising candidates as separators for lithium-ion batteries."

      "ReS2 nanosheets are grown on the surface of carbon black (CB) via an efficient hydrothermal method. We confirmed the ultra-thin ReS2 nanosheets with ≈1-4 layers on the surface of the CB (ReS2@CB) by using analytical techniques of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The ReS2@CB nanocomposite showed high specific capacities of 760, 667, 600, 525, and 473 mAh/g at the current densities of 0.1 (0.23 C), 0.2 (0.46 C), 0.3 (0.7 C), 0.5 (1.15 C) and 1.0 A/g (2.3 C), respectively, in conjunction with its excellent cycling performance (432 mAh/g at 2.3 C; 91.4% capacity retention) after 100 cycles. Such LIB performance is greatly higher than pure CB and ReS2 powder samples. These results could be due to the following reasons: (1) the low-cost CB serves as a supporter enabling the formation of ≈1-4 layered nanosheets of ReS2, thus avoiding its agglomeration; (2) the CB enhances the electrical conductivity of the ReS2@CB nanocomposite; (3) the ultra-thin (1-4 layers) ReS2 nanosheets with imperfect structure can function as increasing the number of active sites for reaction of Li+ ions with electrolytes. The outstanding performance and unique structural characteristics of the ReS2@CB anodes make them promising candidates for the ever-increasing development of advanced LIBs."

      "ZnO nanorods (NRs) decorated with Ni nanoparticles were synthesized using a template-free electrochemical deposition in an ultra-dilute aqueous electrolyte and a subsequent galvanic reaction. The electrochemical properties of the ZnO NRs as an anode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries were evaluated for different binder morphologies (film and close-packed spherical particles) of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Results showed that the close-packed spherical PVDF simultaneously improved electrochemical capacity and cyclability because the free-volume between the spherical PVDF helped to accommodate the volume change in the anode caused by the Li ions discharge and charge processes. Furthermore, the Ni nanoparticles decorated on the surface of ZnO NRs enhanced the electrical conductivity of the ZnO NR anode, which enabled faster electronic and ionic transport at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode, resulting in improved electrochemical capacity. The free-volume formed by the close-packed spherical PVDF, and the decoration of metal nanoparticles are expected to provide insight on the simultaneous improvement of electrochemical capacity and cyclability in other metal oxide anode nanostructures."

      "Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-derived Si@C anode material is prepared by the copolymerization of octavinyl-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (octavinyl-POSS) and styrene. Octavinyl-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane has an inorganic core (-Si₈O12) and an organic vinyl shell. Carbonization of the core-shell structured organic-inorganic hybrid precursor results in the formation of carbon protected Si-based anode material applicable for lithium ion battery. The initial discharge capacity of the battery based on the as-obtained Si@C material Si reaches 1500 mAh g-1. After 550 charge-discharge cycles, a high capacity of 1430 mAh g-1 was maintained. A combined XRD, XPS and TEM analysis was performed to investigate the variation of the discharge performance during the cycling experiments. The results show that the decrease in discharge capacity in the first few cycles is related to the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The subsequent rise in the capacity can be ascribed to the gradual morphology evolution of the anode material and the loss of capacity after long-term cycles is due to the structural pulverization of silicon within the electrode. Our results not only show the high potential of the novel electrode material but also provide insight into the dynamic features of the material during battery cycling, which is useful for the future design of high-performance electrode material."

      "Experimental and numerical studies have shown that mechanical loading associated with lithiation/delithiation may limit the useful life of battery electrode materials. The paper presents an approach to parameterize and compare electrode material performance based on mechanical stability. A mathematical model was developed to determine particle deformation and stress fields based upon an elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive response. Mechanical deformation was computed by combining the stress equilibrium equations with the electrochemical diffusion of lithium ions into the electrode particle. The result provided a time developing stress field which shifts from purely elastic to partially plastic deformation as the lithium-ion diffuses into the particle. The model was used to derive five merit indices that parameterize mechanical stability of electrode materials. The merit indices were used to analyze the mechanical stability for the six candidate electrode materials-three for anode materials and three for the cathode material. Finally, the paper suggests ways to improve the mechanical performance of electrode materials and identifies mechanical properties that need to be considered for selection and optimal design of electrode materials."

      "Silicon is the one of the most promising anode material alternatives for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, the low electronic conductivity, unstable formation of solid electrolyte interphase, and the extremely high volume expansion (up to 300%) which results in pulverization of Si and rapid fading of its capacity have been identified as primary reasons for hindering its application. In this work, we put forward to introduce dual carbonaceous materials synergetic protection to overcome the drawbacks of the silicon anode. The silicon nanoparticle was coated by pyrolysed carbon, and meanwhile anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide, to form a self-standing film composite (C@Si/rGO). The C@Si/rGO film electrode displays high flexibility and an ordered porous structure, which could not only buffer the Si nanoparticle expansion during lithiation/delithiation processes, but also provides the channels for fast electron transfer and lithium ion transport. Therefore, the self-standing C@Si/rGO film electrode shows a high reversible capacity of 1002 mAh g-1 over 100 cycles and exhibits much better rate capability, validating it as a promising anode for constructing high performance lithium-ion batteries."

      "Aiming at the characteristics of the periodic stacking structure of a lithium-ion battery core and the corresponding relationship between the air-coupled ultrasonic transmission initial wave and the wave propagation mode in each layer medium of a lithium-ion battery, the homogenized finite element model of a lithium-ion battery was developed based on the theory of pressure acoustics and solid mechanics. This model provided a reliable method and basis for solving the visualization of ultrasonic propagation in a lithium-ion battery and the analysis of ultrasonic time-frequency domain characteristics. The finite element simulation analysis and experimental verification of a lithium-ion battery with a near-surface stomata defect, near-bottom stomata defect and middle-layer stomata defect were performed. The results showed that the air-coupled ultrasonic transmission signal can effectively characterize the stomata defect inside a lithium-ion battery. The energy of an air-coupled ultrasonic transmission signal is concentrated between 350-450 kHz, and the acoustic diffraction effect has an important influence on the effect of the ultrasonic and stomata defect. Based on the amplitude response characteristics of the air-coupled ultrasonic transmission wave in the stomata defect area, a C-scan of the lithium-ion battery was performed. The C-scan result verified that air-coupled ultrasonic testing technology can accurately and effectively detect the pre-embedded stomata defect and natural stomata defect in a lithium-ion battery, which is able to promote and expand the application of the technology in the field of electric energy security."

      "A one-step hydrothermal method is reported for synthesizing carbon spheres (Cs) with sucrose as the carbon resource for the anode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Firstly, the influences of synthesis temperature and time on particle size and the morphology of the Cs were researched. Then, modified carbon spheres (MCs) were synthesized with some surfactants, such as hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Finally, nano-sized MCs with an average diameter of 70 nm, owning the smooth surface and uniform spherical morphology systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The outstanding performances of nano-sized MCs synthesized with PVA were demonstrated as anode materials in LIBs. The higher initial discharge capacity of 1180 mAhg-1 and the excellent discharge capacity of 470 mAhg-1 were obtained respectively at 100 mAg-1 (0.27 C) over 50 cycles. The nano-sized MCs has also shown remarkable performance of rate capability of 284.6 mAhg-1 at 1.5 C. In addition, the cycling reversibility of the nano-sized MCs is more stable than that of the sub-micron sized MCs modified with CTAB and no surfactant respectively."

      "The nanocomposites of activated-carbon-decorated silicon nanocrystals (AC<nc-Si>AC) were synchronously derived in a single step from biomass rice husks, through the simple route of the calcination method together with the magnesiothermic reduction process. The final product, AC<nc-Si>AC, exhibited an aggregated structure of activated-carbon-encapsulated nanocrystalline silicon spheres, and reveals a high specific surface area (498.5 m2/g). Owing to the mutualization of advantages from both silicon nanocrystals (i.e., low discharge potential and high specific capacity) and activated carbon (i.e., high porosity and good electrical conductivity), the AC<nc-Si>AC nanocomposites are able to play a substantial role as an anodic source material for the lithium-ion battery (LIB). Namely, a high coulombic efficiency (97.5%), a high discharge capacity (716 mAh/g), and a high reversible specific capacity (429 mAh/g after 100 cycles) were accomplished when using AC<nc-Si>AC as an LIB anode. The results advocate that the simultaneous synthesis of biomass-derived AC<nc-Si>AC is beneficial for green energy-storage device applications."

      "Despite the importance of studying the instability of delithiated cathode materials, it remains difficult to underpin the degradation mechanism of lithium-rich cathode materials due to the complication of combined chemical and structural evolutions. Herein, we use state-of-the-art electron microscopy tools, in conjunction with synchrotron X-ray techniques and first-principle calculations to study a 4d-element-containing compound, Li2Ru0.5Mn0.5O3. We find surprisingly, after cycling, ruthenium segregates out as metallic nanoclusters on the reconstructed surface. Our calculations show that the unexpected ruthenium metal segregation is due to its thermodynamic insolubility in the oxygen deprived surface. This insolubility can disrupt the reconstructed surface, which explains the formation of a porous structure in this material. This work reveals the importance of studying the thermodynamic stability of the reconstructed film on the cathode materials and offers a theoretical guidance for choosing manganese substituting elements in lithium-rich as well as stoichiometric layer-layer compounds for stabilizing the cathode surface."

      "In this work, LiFePO₄/C composite were synthesized via a green route by using Iron (III) oxide (Fe₂O₃) nanoparticles, Lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃), glucose powder and phosphoric acid (H₃PO₄) solution as raw materials. The reaction principles for the synthesis of LiFePO₄/C composite were analyzed, suggesting that almost no wastewater and air polluted gases are discharged into the environment. The morphological, structural and compositional properties of the LiFePO₄/C composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra coupled with thermogravimetry/Differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) thermal analysis in detail. Lithium-ion batteries using such LiFePO₄/C composite as cathode materials, where the loading level is 2.2 mg/cm², exhibited excellent electrochemical performances, with a discharge capability of 161 mA h/g at 0.1 C, 119 mA h/g at 10 C and 93 mA h/g at 20 C, and a cycling stability with 98.0% capacity retention at 1 C after 100 cycles and 95.1% at 5 C after 200 cycles. These results provide a valuable approach to reduce the manufacturing costs of LiFePO₄/C cathode materials due to the reduced process for the polluted exhaust purification and wastewater treatment."

      "In this work, a side-by-side bicomponent thermoplastic polyurethane/polyimide (TPU/PI) polymer electrolyte prepared with side-by-side electrospinning method is reported for the first time. Symmetrical TPU and PI co-occur on one fiber, and are connected by an interface transition layer formed by the interdiffusion of two solutions. This structure of the as-prepared TPU/PI polymer electrolyte can integrate the advantages of high thermal stable PI and good mechanical strength TPU, and mechanical strength is further increased by those isotropic interface transition layers. Moreover, benefiting from micro-nano pores and the high porosity of the structure, TPU/PI polymer electrolyte presents high electrolyte uptake (665%) and excellent ionic conductivity (5.06 mS·cm-1) at room temperature. Compared with PE separator, TPU/PI polymer electrolyte exhibited better electrochemical stability, and using it as the electrolyte and separator, the assembled Li/LiMn₂O₄ cell exhibits low inner resistance, stable cyclic and notably high rate performance. Our study indicates that the TPU/PI membrane is a promising polymer electrolyte for high safety lithium-ion batteries."

      "Although silicon is a promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries, scalable synthesis of silicon anodes with good cyclability and low electrode swelling remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a scalable top-down technique to produce ant-nest-like porous silicon from magnesium-silicon alloy. The ant-nest-like porous silicon comprising three-dimensional interconnected silicon nanoligaments and bicontinuous nanopores can prevent pulverization and accommodate volume expansion during cycling resulting in negligible particle-level outward expansion. The carbon-coated porous silicon anode delivers a high capacity of 1,271 mAh g-1 at 2,100 mA g-1 with 90% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles and has a low electrode swelling of 17.8% at a high areal capacity of 5.1 mAh cm-2. The full cell with the prelithiated silicon anode and Li(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)O2 cathode boasts a high energy density of 502 Wh Kg-1 and 84% capacity retention after 400 cycles. This work provides insights into the rational design of alloy anodes for high-energy batteries."

      "The present investigation elucidates a simple hydrothermal method for preparing nanostructured bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) and carbon quantum dot (CQD) composite using spoiled (denatured) milk-derived CQDs. The formation of the CQD-Bi2O3 composite was confirmed by UV-vis absorption, steady-state emission, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy studies. The crystal structure and chemical composition of the composite were examined by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The surface morphology and the particle size distribution of the CQD-Bi2O3 were examined using field emission scanning electron microscope and high-resolution transmission electron microscope observations. As an anode material in lithium-ion battery, the CQD-Bi2O3 composite exhibited good electrochemical activity and delivered a discharge capacity as high as 1500 mA h g-1 at 0.2C rate. The supercapacitor properties of the CQD-Bi2O3 composite electrode revealed good reversibility and a high specific capacity of 343 C g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in 3 M KOH. The asymmetric device constructed using the CQD-Bi2O3 and reduced graphene oxide delivered a maximum energy density of 88 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 2799 W kg-1, while the power density reached a highest value of 8400 W kg-1 at the energy density of 32 Wh kg-1. The practical viability of the fabricated device is demonstrated by glowing light-emitting diodes. It is inferred that the presence of conductive carbon network has significantly increased the conductivity of the oxide matrix, thereby reducing the interfacial resistance that resulted in excellent electrochemical performances."

      "Lithium extraction from high Mg/Li ratio brine is a key technical problem in the world. Based on the principle of rocking-chair lithium-ion batteries, cathode material LiFePO4 is applied to extract lithium from brine, and a novel lithium-ion battery system of LiFePO4 | NaCl solution | anion-exchange membrane | brine | FePO4 is constructed. In this method, Li+ is selectively absorbed from the brine by FePO4 (Li+ + e + FePO4 = LiFePO4); meanwhile, Li+ is desorbed from LiFePO4 (LiFePO4 - e = Li+ + FePO4) and enriched efficiently. To treat a raw brine solution, the Mg/Li ratio decreases from the initial 134.4 in the brine to 1.2 in the obtained anolyte and 83% lithium is extracted. For the treatment of an old brine solution, the Mg/Li ratio decreases from the initial 48.4 in the brine to 0.5 and the concentration of lithium in the anolyte is accumulated about six times (from the initial 0.51 g L-1 in the brine to 3.2 g L-1 in the anolyte), with the absorption capacity of about 25 mg (Li) g (LiFePO4)-1. Additionally, it displays a great perspective on the application in light of its high selectively, good cycling performance, effective lithium enrichment, environmental friendliness, low cost, and avoidance of poisonous organic reagents and harmful acid or oxidant."

      "Water-based inks were formulated using cellulose nanofibers as a binder in order to directly front/reverse print lithium ion cells on a paper separator. Moreover, the high cohesion of electrodes as provided by cellulose nanofibers allowed for the embedding metallic current collectors in the electrodes during the printing stage, in order to develop a one-step printing and assembling process. Positive and negative inks based on LiFePO₄, or graphite, respectively, and cellulose nanofibers, displayed rheological properties complying with a variety of printing processes, as well as with screen printing. Printed cells exhibited high electrical conductivity and adhesion between current collectors and inks, i.e., up to 64 ± 1 J/m². Electrochemical cycling tests at C/10 showed a reversible capacity during the first cycle of about 80 mAh/g, which slightly decayed upon cycling. Preliminary results and assembling strategies can be considered as promising, and they represent a quick solution for the manufacturing of lithium ion batteries. Work is in progress to improve these processing issues and the cycling performances of Li-ion cells."

      "Lithium ion batteries as a power source are dominating in portable electronics, penetrating the electric vehicle market, and on the verge of entering the utility market for grid-energy storage. Depending on the application, trade-offs among the various performance parameters-energy, power, cycle life, cost, safety, and environmental impact-are often needed, which are linked to severe materials chemistry challenges. The current lithium ion battery technology is based on insertion-reaction electrodes and organic liquid electrolytes. With an aim to increase the energy density or optimize the other performance parameters, new electrode materials based on both insertion reaction and dominantly conversion reaction along with solid electrolytes and lithium metal anode are being intensively pursued. This article presents an outlook on lithium ion technology by providing first the current status and then the progress and challenges with the ongoing approaches. In light of the formidable challenges with some of the approaches, the article finally points out practically viable near-term strategies."

      "To achieve the urgent requirement for high volumetric energy density in lithium-ion batteries, alloy-based anodes have been spotlighted as next-generation alternatives. Nonetheless, for the veritable accomplishment with regards to high-energy demand, alloy-based anodes must be evaluated considering several crucial factors that determine volumetric capacity. In particular, the electrode swelling upon cycling must be contemplated if these anodes are to replace conventional graphite anodes in terms of volumetric capacity. Herein, we propose macropore-coordinated graphite-silicon composite by incorporating simulation and mathematical calculation of numerical values from experimental data. This unique structure exhibits minimized electrode swelling comparable to conventional graphite under industrial electrode fabrication conditions. Consequently, this hybrid anode, even with high specific capacity (527 mAh g-1) and initial coulombic efficiency (93%) in half-cell, achieves higher volumetric capacity (493.9 mAh cm-3) and energy density (1825.7 Wh L-1) than conventional graphite (361.4 mAh cm-3 and 1376.3 Wh L-1) after 100 cycles in the full-cell configuration."

      "The paper reports a novel flexible full-cell lithium ion battery (LIB) through a simple plastic package method. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are synthesized by electrospinning technology and the subsequent carbonation process. The CNFs with three-dimensional interconnected fibrous nanostructure exhibit a stable reversible capacity of 412 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles in the half-cell testing. A full cell is assembled by using CNF anode and commercial LiCoO2 cathode, and it displays good flexibility and lighting LED ability. The aggregate thickness of the constructed full-cell LIB is approximately 500 μm, consisting of a CNFs/Cu film, a separator, a LiCoO2/Al film, electrolyte, and two polyvinyl chloride (PVC) films. The structure, morphology, and the electrochemical performances of electrospun CNFs and LiCoO2 electrodes are analyzed in details."

      "The development of high energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has spurred the designing and production of novel anode materials to substitute currently commercial using graphitic materials. Herein, twisted SiC nanofibers toward LIBs anode materials, containing 92.5 wt% cubic β-SiC and 7.5 wt% amorphous C, were successfully synthesized from resin-silica composites. The electrochemical measurements showed that the SiC-based electrode delivered a stable reversible capacity of 254.5 mAh g-1 after 250 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. It is interesting that a high discharge capacity of 540.1 mAh g-1 was achieved after 500 cycles at an even higher current density of 0.3 A g-1, which is higher than the theoretical capacity of graphite. The results imply that SiC nanomaterials are potential anode candidate for LIBs with high stability due to their high structure stability as supported with the transmission electron microscopy images."

      "We demonstrate significant improvement of CuO nanowire arrays as anode materials for lithium ion batteries by coating with thin NiO nanosheets conformally. The NiO nanosheets were designed two kinds of morphologies, which are porous and non-porous. By the NiO nanosheets coating, the major active CuO nanowires were protected from direct contact with the electrolyte to improve the surface chemical stability. Simultaneously, through the observation and comparison of TEM results of crystalline non-porous NiO nanosheets, before and after lithiation process, we clearly prove the effect of expected protection of CuO, and clarify the differences of phase transition, crystallinity change, ionic conduction and the mechanisms of the capacity decay further. Subsequently, the electrochemical performances exhibit lithiation and delithiation differences of the porous and non-porous NiO nanosheets, and confirm that the presence of the non-porous NiO coating can still effectively assist the diffusion of Li+ ions into the CuO nanowires, maintaining the advantage of high surface area, and improves the cycle performance of CuO nanowires, leading to enhanced battery capacity. Optimally, the best structure is validated to be non-porous NiO nanosheets, in contrary to the anticipated porous NiO nanosheets. In addition, considering the low cost and facile fabrication process can be realized further for practical applications."

      "A liquid-like poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) with a very low glass transition temperature of -51 °C and a thermal decomposition temperature of 202.7 °C was synthesized. A PIL-based electrolyte by mixing this poly(ionic liquid) with additives of 10 wt % propylene carbonate and 0.1 M LiClO4 is proved to be an excellent electrolyte for lithium-ion battery. The obtained PIL-based electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 8.3 × 10-5 S cm-1 at 25 °C and 2.0 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 60 °C and a wide electrochemical potential window up to 5.61 V at 25 °C and 4.14 V at 60 °C. The Li/LiFePO4 batteries equipped with this PIL-based electrolyte achieve high capacity, outstanding cycling stability and rate capability at 25 °C, and even improved performance at high temperature like 60 °C. Such excellent performances of batteries are attributed to the formation of stable solid-electrolyte interface film at the lithium-electrolyte interface and the stability of electrolyte during cycling."

      "An electrochemical Lithium ion battery model was built taking into account the electrochemical reactions. The polarization was divided into parts which were related to the solid phase and the electrolyte mass transport of species, and the electrochemical reactions. The influence factors on battery polarization were studied, including the active material particle radius and the electrolyte salt concentration. The results showed that diffusion polarization exist in the positive and negative electrodes, and diffusion polarization increase with the conducting of the discharge process. The physicochemical parameters of the Lithium ion battery had the huge effect on cell voltage via polarization. The simulation data show that the polarization voltage has close relationship with active material particle size, discharging rate and ambient temperature."

      "Tungsten (W) was coated onto a silicon (Si) anode at the nanoscale via the physical vaporization deposition method (PVD) to enhance its electrochemical properties. The characteristics of the electrode were identified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and electron probe X-ray microanalysis. With the electrochemical property analysis, the first charge capacities of the W-coated and uncoated electrode cells were 2558 mAh g- 1 and 1912 mAh g- 1, respectively. By the 50th cycle, the capacity ratios were 61.1 and 25.5%, respectively. Morphology changes in the W-coated Si anode during cycling were observed using SEM and TEM, and electrochemical characteristics were examined through impedance analysis. Owing to its conductivity and mechanical properties from the atomic W layer coating through PVD, the electrode improved its cyclability and preserved its structure from volumetric demolition."

      "In this work, we propose a facile method for manufacturing a three-dimensional copper foil-powder sintering current collector (CFSCC) for a silicon-based anode lithium-ion battery. We found that the CFSCC is suitable as a silicon-based paste electrode, and the paste-like electrodes are commonly used in industrial production. Compared with flat current collectors, the CFSCC better constrained the silicon volume change during the charging-discharging process. The capacitance of electrodes with CFSCC remained as high as 92.2% of its second cycle after 40 cycles, whereas that of electrodes with a flat current collector only remained at 50%."

      "In order to meet the global demand for lithium‐ion batteries, salt lakes have been targeted as a source of lithium. However, extracting lithium from brine that contains a high Mg/Li ratio is a challenge due to the similar chemical properties of Mg and Li. In article number 1700079 by Zhongwei Zhao and co‐workers, a novel electrochemical cell is used to extract lithium from brine with high selectivity: LiFePO (anode) | NaCl solution | anion exchange membrane | brine |FePO (cathode). The system demonstrates good cycling performance, effective lithium enrichment, low cost, and use of environmentally friendly materials, making it a practical means to address the issue of lithium extraction."

      "Waterborne polyurethane (WPU) is first used as a carbon-coating source for micrometre-sized silicon. The remaining nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) heteroatoms during pyrolysis of the WPU interact with the surface oxide on the silicon (Si) particles via hydrogen bonding (Si-OH⋯N and Si-OH⋯O). The N and O atoms involved in the carbon network can interact with the lithium ions, which is conducive to lithium-ion insertion. A satisfactory performance of the Si@N, O-doped carbon (Si@CNO) anode is gained at 25 and 55°C. The Si@CNO anode shows stable cycling performance (capacity retention of 70.0% over 100 cycles at 25°C and 60.3% over 90 cycles at 55°C with a current density of 500 mA g-1) and a superior rate capacity of 864.1 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 (25°C). The improved electrochemical performance of the Si@CNO electrode is attributed to the enhanced electrical conductivity and structural stability."

      "Mechanochemical synthesis of Si/Cu3Si-based composite as negative electrode materials for lithium ion battery is investigated. Results indicate that CuO is decomposed and alloyed with Si forming amorphous Cu-Si solid solution due to high energy impacting during high energy mechanical milling (HEMM). Upon carbonization at 800 °C, heating energy induces Cu3Si to crystallize in nanocrystalline/amorphous Si-rich matrix enhancing composite rigidity and conductivity. In addition, residual carbon formed on outside surface of composite powder as a buff space further alleviates volume change upon lithiation/delithiation. Thus, coin cell made of C-coated Si/Cu3Si-based composite as negative electrode (active materials loading, 2.3 mg cm-2) conducted at 100 mA g-1 performs the initial charge capacity of 1812 mAh g-1 (4.08 mAh cm-2) columbic efficiency of 83.7% and retained charge capacity of 1470 mAh g-1 (3.31 mAh cm-2) at the end of the 100th cycle, opening a promised window as negative electrode materials for lithium ion batteries."

      "The separator membrane is an essential component of lithium-ion batteries, separating the anode and cathode, and controlling the number and mobility of the lithium ions. Among the polymer matrices most commonly investigated for battery separators are poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE), poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP), and poly(vinylidene fluoride-cochlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVDF-CTFE), due to their excellent properties such as high polarity and the possibility of controlling the porosity of the materials through binary and ternary polymer/solvent systems, among others. This review presents the recent advances on battery separators based on PVDF and its copolymers for lithium-ion batteries. It is divided into the following sections: single polymer and co-polymers, surface modification, composites, and polymer blends. Further, a critical comparison between those membranes and other separator membranes is presented, as well as the future trends on this area."

      "Artificial graphite (FSN) additive is employed as internal structural label for projecting cyclability of Si material native electrode in a mass ratio of Si/FSN = 1.0 in Li ion battery (LIB). Results of operando X-ray diffraction analysis on Si-FSN negative electrode in LIB demonstrate that one can evaluate the lithiation and delithiation affinity of active material by referring phase transition delay of graphite as affected by experimental splits in a formation process of LIB. We prove that a thin layer of surface amorphous structure and residual lattice strain are formed in Si by high energy ball-milling treatment. Those manipulations improve Li intercalation kinetics and thus enabling a capacity fading of less than 10% (from 1860 to 1650 mAhg-1) for Si negative electrode in 50 cycles. Of utmost importance, this study discloses a robust assessment for revealing mechanism on amorphous and strain related silicide formation and predicting cyclability of negative electrode by quantitative phase evolution rate of FSN additive in LIB."

      "Flame retardant tris(2-chloroethyl phosphate) (TCP) is successfully encapsulated in core-shell poly(urea-formaldehyde) microcapsules by in situ polymerization. The microcapsules are electrochemically stable in lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery electrolytes and thermally stable to ca. 200 °C. Thermal triggering of these microcapsules at higher temperatures ruptures the shell wall, releasing the liquid core (flame retardant), and NMR spectroscopy confirms the presence of the flame retardant in the electrolyte solution. Li-ion pouch cell experiments demonstrate that microencapsulation of TCP and its incorporation into the battery electrolyte provide latent fire retardants that improve battery safety while maintaining inherent battery performance and cycling capability."

      "In a world where millions of people are dependent on batteries to provide them with convenient and portable energy, battery recycling is of the utmost importance. In this paper, we developed a new method to sort 18650 Lithium-ion batteries in large quantities and in real time for harvesting used cells with enough capacity for battery reuse. Internal resistance and capacity tests were conducted as a basis for comparison with a novel degradation-based method based on X-ray radiographic scanning and digital image contrast computation. The test results indicate that the sorting accuracy of the test cells is about 79% and the execution time of our algorithm is at a level of 200 milliseconds, making our method a potential real-time solution for reusing the remaining capacity in good used cells."

      "In an effort to explore the use of organic high-performance lithium ion battery cathodes as an alternative to resolve the current bottleneck hampering the development of their inorganic counterparts, a rational strategy focusing on the optimal composition of covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) with carbon-based materials of varied dimensionalities is delineated. Two-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with a compatible structural conformation with the layered CTF is the most suitable scaffold for the tailored mesopores in the polymeric framework, providing outstanding energy storage ability. Through facile ionothermal synthesis and structure engineering, the obtained CTF-rGO composite possesses a high specific surface area of 1357.27 m²/g, and when used as a lithium ion battery cathode it delivers a large capacity of 235 mAh/g in 80 cycles at 0.1 A/g along with a stable capacity of 127 mAh/g over 2500 cycles at 5 A/g. The composite with modified pore structure shows drastically improved performance compared to a pristine CTF, especially at large discharge currents. The CTF-rGO composite with excellent capacity, stability, and rate performance shows great promise as an emerging high-performance cathode that could revolutionize the conventional lithium-ion battery industry."

      "Lithium-ion battery fires generate intense heat and considerable amounts of gas and smoke. Although the emission of toxic gases can be a larger threat than the heat, the knowledge of such emissions is limited. This paper presents quantitative measurements of heat release and fluoride gas emissions during battery fires for seven different types of commercial lithium-ion batteries. The results have been validated using two independent measurement techniques and show that large amounts of hydrogen fluoride (HF) may be generated, ranging between 20 and 200 mg/Wh of nominal battery energy capacity. In addition, 15-22 mg/Wh of another potentially toxic gas, phosphoryl fluoride (POF3), was measured in some of the fire tests. Gas emissions when using water mist as extinguishing agent were also investigated. Fluoride gas emission can pose a serious toxic threat and the results are crucial findings for risk assessment and management, especially for large Li-ion battery packs."

      "A novel polyethylene terephthalate nonwoven reinforced polypropylene composite separator (PET/PP) with high thermal stability and low thermal shrinkage characteristic is developed through a scalable production process. In the composite separator, the electronspun polyethylene terephthalate nonwoven layer improves the electrolyte affinity and can sustain as the barrier layer after the shutdown of the polypropylene layer. Due to its high ionic conductivity, the PET/PP separator shows an excellent discharge capacity. In addition, the superior thermal stability of the separator significantly enhances the safety performance of the separator. Considering the feasibility of the large-scale production of the PET/PP separator and its superior battery performance, we expect that the novel separator could be a promising alternative to the existing commercial separators."

      "A novel bismuth-carbon composite, in which bismuth nanoparticles were anchored in a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Bi@NC), is proposed as anode for high volumetric energy density lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Bi@NC composite was synthesized via carbonization of Zn-containing zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF-8) and replacement of Zn with Bi, resulting in the N-doped carbon that was hierarchically porous and anchored with Bi nanoparticles. The matrix provides a highly electronic conductive network that facilitates the lithiation/delithiation of Bi. Additionally, it restrains aggregation of Bi nanoparticles and serves as a buffer layer to alleviate the mechanical strain of Bi nanoparticles upon Li insertion/extraction. With these contributions, Bi@NC exhibits excellent cycling stability and rate capacity compared to bare Bi nanoparticles or their simple composites with carbon. This study provides a new approach for fabricating high volumetric energy density LIBs."

      "Ni₃S₂ nanocrystals wrapped by thin carbon layer and anchored on the sheets of reduced graphene oxide (Ni₃S₂@C/RGO) have been synthesized by a spray-coagulation assisted hydrothermal method and combined with a calcination process. Cellulose, dissolved in Thiourea/NaOH aqueous solution is chosen as carbon sources and mixed with graphene oxide via a spray-coagulation method using graphene suspension as coagulation bath. The resulted cellulose/graphene suspension is utilized as solvent for dissolving of Ni(NO₃)₂ and then used as raw materials for hydrothermal preparation of the Ni₃S₂@C/RGO composites. The structure of the composites has been investigated and their electrochemical properties are evaluated as anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The Ni₃S₂@C/RGO sample exhibits increasing reversible capacities upon cycles and shows a superior rate performance as well. Such kinds of promising performance have been ascribed to the wrapping effect of carbon layer which confines the dislocation of the polycrystals formed upon cycles and the enhanced conductivity as the integration of RGO conductive substrate. Discharge capacities up to 850 and 630 mAh·g-1 at current densities of 200 and 5000 mA·g-1, respectively, are obtained. The evolution of electrochemical performance of the composites with structure variation of the encapsulated Ni₃S₂ nanocrystals has been revealed by ex-situ TEM and XRD measurements."

      "Rice husk is produced in a massive amount worldwide as a byproduct of rice cultivation. Rice husk contains approximately 20 wt% of mesoporous SiO2. We produce mesoporous silicon (Si) by reducing the rice husk-originating SiO2 using a magnesio-milling process. Taking advantage of meso-porosity and large available quantity, we apply rice husk-originating Si to lithium ion battery anodes in a composite form with commercial graphite. By varying the mass ratio between these two components, trade-off relation between specific capacity and cycle life was observed. A controllable pre-lithiation scheme was adopted to increase the initial Coulombic efficiency and energy density. The series of electrochemical results suggest that rice husk-originating Si-graphite composites are promising candidates for high capacity lithium ion battery anodes, with the prominent advantages in battery performance and scalability."

      "This study addresses the effects of the SOC (State of Charge) and the charging-discharging process on the thermal runaway of 18650 lithium-ion batteries. A series of experiments were conducted on an electric heating and testing apparatus. The experimental results indicate that 6 W is the critical heating power for 40% SOC. With a 20 W constant heating rate, the thermal runaway initial temperature of the lithium-ion battery decreases with the increasing SOC. The final thermal runaway temperature increases with the SOC when the SOC is lower than 80%. However, a contrary conclusion was obtained when the SOC was higher than 80%. Significant mass loss, accompanied by an intense exothermic reaction, took place under a higher SOC. The critical charging current, beyond which the thermal runaway occurs, was found to be 2.6 A. The thermal runaway initial temperature decreases with the increasing charging current, while the intensity of the exothermic reaction varies inversely. Mass ejection of gas and electrolytes exists during thermal runaway when the charging current is higher than 10.4 A, below which only a large amount of gas is released. The thermal runaway initial temperature of discharging is higher than that of non-discharging."

      "Lithium cation is the charge carrier in lithium-ion battery. Electrolyte solution in lithium-ion battery is usually based on mixed solvents consisting of polar carbonates with different aliphatic chains. Despite various experimental evidences indicating that lithium ion forms a rigid and stable solvation sheath through electrostatic interactions with polar carbonates, both the lithium solvation structure and more importantly fluctuation dynamics and functional role of carbonate solvent molecules have not been fully elucidated yet with femtosecond vibrational spectroscopic methods. Here we investigate the ultrafast carbonate solvent exchange dynamics around lithium ions in electrolyte solutions with coherent two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and find that the time constants of the formation and dissociation of lithium-ion···carbonate complex in solvation sheaths are on a picosecond timescale. We anticipate that such ultrafast microscopic fluxional processes in lithium-solvent complexes could provide an important clue to understanding macroscopic mobility of lithium cation in lithium-ion battery on a molecular level."

      "In this work, the ceramic coating separator (CCS-CS) prepared with polyethylene (PE) separator, Al₂O₃ inorganic particles, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) mix binders is further modified by coating with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer through a simple chemical deposition method. Compared with the bare ceramic coating separator, the PDA-modified CCS-CS (CCS-CS-PDA) exhibits excellent thermal stability, which shows no thermal shrinkage after storing at 200 °C for 30 min. Compared with the PE separator, both the uptake and wettability with the electrolyte and water of CCS-CS-PDA are improved significantly. Meanwhile, when saturated with liquid electrolyte, the CCS-CS-PDA also shows enabled high ionic conductance. Furthermore, the test of the electrochemical impedances changing with the temperatures suggests that only the PE separator exhibits no thermal shutdown behaviors, and the CCS-CS separator only has a shutdown temperature range from 138 to 160 °C, while the CCS-CS-PDA shows a shutdown temperature range from 138 to more than 200 °C. The cells prepared with the CCS-CS-PDA also show stable repeated cycling performance and good rate capacity at room temperature."

      "Rational design of high performance anode material with outstanding rate capability and cycling stability is of great importance for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, a series of NiO/NiFe2O4 hetero-structures with adjustable porosity, particle size, and shell/internal structure have been synthesized via a controllable annealing process. The optimized NiO/NiFe2O4 (S-NFO) is hierarchical hollow nanocube that is composed of ~5 nm subunits and high porosity. When being applied as anode for LIBs, the S-NFO exhibits high rate capability and excellent cycle stability, which remains high capacity of 1,052 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 5.0 A g-1 and even 344 mAh g-1 after 2,000 cycles at 20 A g-1. Such impressive electrochemical performance of S-NFO is mainly due to three reasons. One is high porosity of its hierarchical hollow shell, which not only promotes the penetration of electrolyte, but also accommodates the volume change during cycling. Another is the small particle size of its subunits, which can effectively shorten the electron/ion diffusion distance and provide more active sites for Li+ storage. Besides, the hetero-interfaces between NiO and NiFe2O4 also contribute toitsfast charge transport."

      "Finding a viable electrolyte for next-generation 5 V-class lithium-ion batteries is of primary importance. A long-standing obstacle has been metal-ion dissolution at high voltages. The LiPF6 salt in conventional electrolytes is chemically unstable, which accelerates transition metal dissolution of the electrode material, yet beneficially suppresses oxidative dissolution of the aluminium current collector; replacing LiPF6 with more stable lithium salts may diminish transition metal dissolution but unfortunately encounters severe aluminium oxidation. Here we report an electrolyte design that can solve this dilemma. By mixing a stable lithium salt LiN(SO2F)2 with dimethyl carbonate solvent at extremely high concentrations, we obtain an unusual liquid showing a three-dimensional network of anions and solvent molecules that coordinate strongly to Li(+) ions. This simple formulation of superconcentrated LiN(SO2F)2/dimethyl carbonate electrolyte inhibits the dissolution of both aluminium and transition metal at around 5 V, and realizes a high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/graphite battery that exhibits excellent cycling durability, high rate capability and enhanced safety."

      "Energy and environmental pollution have become the two major problems in today's society. The development of green energy storage devices with good safety, high reliability, high energy density and low cost are urgently demanded. Here we report on a lithium ion battery using an aqueous electrolyte solution. It is built up by using graphite coated with gel polymer membrane and LISICON as the negative electrode, and LiFePO4 in aqueous solution as the positive electrode. Its average discharge voltage is up to 3.1 V and energy density based on the two electrode materials is 258 Wh kg(-1). It will be a promising energy storage system with good safety and efficient cooling effects."

      "Through a facile sodium sulfide (Na2S)-assisted hydrothermal treatment, clean and nondefective surfaces are constructed on micrometer-sized Li4Ti5O12 particles. The remarkable improvement of surface quality shows a higher first cycle Coulombic efficiency (≈95%), a significantly enhanced cycling performance, and a better rate capability in electrochemical measurements. A combined study of Raman spectroscopy and inductive coupled plasma emission spectroscopy reveals that the evolution of Li4Ti5O12 surface in a water-based hydrothermal environment is a hydrolysis-recrystallization process, which can introduce a new phase of anatase-TiO2. While, with a small amount of Na2S (0.004 mol L-1 at least), the spinel-Li4Ti5O12 phase is maintained without a second phase. During this process, the alkaline environment created by Na2S and the surface adsorption of the sulfur-containing group (HS- or S2-) can suppress the recrystallization of anatase-TiO2 and renew the particle surfaces. This finding gives a better understanding of the surface-property relationship on Li4Ti5O12 and guidance on preparation and modification of electrode material other than coating or doping."

      "Silicon has emerged as the most promising high-capacity material for lithium-ion batteries. Waste glass can be a potential low cost and environmentally benign silica resource enabling production of nanosized silicon at the industry level. Windshields are generally made of laminated glass comprising two separate glass bonded together with a layer of polyvinyl butyral sandwiched between them. Herein, silicon/carbon nanocomposites are fabricated from windshields for the first time via magnesiothermic reduction and facile carbonization process using both waste glass and polyvinyl butyral as silica and carbon sources, respectively. High purity reduced silicon has unique 3-dimensional nanostructure with large surface area. Furthermore, the incorporation of carbon in silicon enable to retain the composite anodes highly conductive and mechanically robust, thus providing enhanced cycle stability."

      "Delithiation followed by lithiation of Li+-occupied (n-type) tetrahedral sites of cubic LiMn2O4 spinel (LMO) at ~4 [Formula: see text] (delivering ~100 mAh gLMO-1) has been used for energy storage by lithium ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, we utilized unoccupied (p-type) octahedral sites of LMO available for lithiation at ~3 [Formula: see text] (delivering additional ~100 mAh gLMO-1) that have never been used for LIBs in full-cell configuration. The whole capacity of amphi-redox LMO, including both oxidizable n-type and reducible p-type redox sites, at ~200 mAh gLMO-1 was realized by using the reactions both at 4 [Formula: see text] and 3 [Formula: see text]. Durable reversibility of the 3 V reaction was achieved by graphene-wrapping LMO nanoparticles (LMO@Gn). Prelithiated graphite (LinC6, n < 1) was used as anodes to lithiate the unoccupied octahedral sites of LMO for the 3 V reaction."

      "Polymer-derived silicon carbonitride (SiCN) materials have been synthesized via pyrolyzing from five poly(silylcarbondiimide)s with different contents of carbon (labeled as 1-5#). The morphological and structural measurements show that the SiCN materials are mixtures of nanocrystals of SiC, Si3N4, and graphite. The SiCN materials have been used as anodes for lithium-ion batteries. Among the five polymer-derived SiCN materials, 5#SiCN, derived from dichloromethylvinylsilane and di-n-octyldichlorosilane, has the best cycle stability and a high-rate performance at the low cutoff voltage of 0.01-1.0 V. In lithium-ion half-cells, the specific delithiation capacity of 5#SiCN anode still remains at 826.7 mA h g-1 after 100 charge/discharge cycles; it can even deliver the capacity above 550 mA h g-1 at high current densities of 1.6 and 2 A g-1. In lithium-ion full cells, 5#SiCN anode works well with LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 commercial cathode. The outstanding electrochemical performance of 5#SiCN anode is attributed to two factors: (1) the formation of a stable and compact solid electrolyte interface layer on the anode surface anode, which protects the electrode from cracking during the charge/discharge cycle; and (2) a large amount of carbon component and the less Si3N4 phase in the 5#SiCN structure, which provides an electrochemical reactive and conductive environment in the SiCN structure, benefit the lithiation/delithiation process. In addition, we explore the reason for the capacity fading of these SiCN anodes."

      "Herein, we improved the performance of Si/graphite (Si/C) composite anodes by introducing a highly adhesive co-polyimide (P84) binder and investigated the relationship between their electrochemical and adhesion properties using the 90° peel test and a surface and interfacial cutting analysis system. Compared to those of conventional poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF)-based electrodes, the cycling performance and rate capability of P84-based Si/C anodes were improved by 47.0% (372 vs 547 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles at a 60 mA g-1 discharge condition) and 33.4% (359 vs 479 mAh g-1 after 70 cycles at a 3.0 A g-1 discharge condition), respectively. Importantly, the P84-based electrodes exhibited less pronounced morphological changes and a smaller total cell resistance after cycling than the PVdF-based ones, also showing better interlayer adhesion (F mid) and interfacial adhesion to Cu current collectors (F inter)."

      "The typical co-precipitation method was adopted to synthesized the Li-excess Li1.20[Mn0.52-xZr x Ni0.20Co0.08]O2 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03) series cathode materials. The influences of Zr4+ doping modification on the microstructure and micromorphology of Li1.20[Mn0.52Ni0.20Co0.08]O2 cathode materials were studied intensively by the combinations of XRD, SEM, LPS and XPS. Besides, after the doping modification with zirconium ions, Li1.20[Mn0.52Ni0.20Co0.08]O2 cathode demonstrated the lower cation mixing, superior cycling performance and higher rate capacities. Among the four cathode materials, the Li1.20[Mn0.50Zr0.02Ni0.20Co0.08]O2 exhibited the prime electrochemical properties with a capacity retention of 88.7% (201.0 mAh g-1) after 100 cycles at 45 °C and a discharge capacity of 114.7 mAh g-1 at 2 C rate. The EIS results showed that the Zr4+ doping modification can relieve the thickening of SEI films on the surface of cathode and accelerate the Li+ diffusion rate during the charge and discharge process."

      "Ultralong, as long as ∼1 mm, orthorhombic vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowires were synthesized using a hydrothermal method. Free-standing and binder-free composite paper was prepared on a large scale by a two-step reduction method using free-standing V2O5 nanowires as the skeleton and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets as the additive. Such a free-standing V2O5/rGO composite paper as a cathode for lithium ion batteries possesses both structural integrity and extraordinary electrochemical performance. The reversible specific areal capacity of the V2O5/rGO composite paper electrode is 885 μAh/cm2 at 0.09 mA/cm2, much higher than that of the pure V2O5 nanowire paper electrode (570 μAh/cm2). It also shows excellent cycling performance at high rates with 30.9% loss of its initial capacities after 1000 cycles at a current rate of 0.9 mA/cm2. The excellent performance was attributed to the improved electronic conductivity and Li+ ion transport from the rGO addition."

      "The requirement of energy-storage equipment needs to develop the lithium ion battery (LIB) with high electrochemical performance. The surface modification of commercial LiFePO4 (LFP) by utilizing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) offers new possibilities for commercial LFP with high electrochemical performances. In this work, the carbonized ZIF-8 (CZIF-8) was coated on the surface of LFP particles by the in situ growth and carbonization of ZIF-8. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that there is an approximate 10 nm coating layer with metal zinc and graphite-like carbon on the surface of LFP/CZIF-8 sample. The N2 adsorption and desorption isotherm suggests that the coating layer has uniform and simple connecting mesopores. As cathode material, LFP/CZIF-8 cathode-active material delivers a discharge specific capacity of 159.3 mAh g-1 at 0.1C and a discharge specific energy of 141.7 mWh g-1 after 200 cycles at 5.0C (the retention rate is approximate 99%). These results are attributed to the synergy improvement of the conductivity, the lithium ion diffusion coefficient, and the degree of freedom for volume change of LFP/CZIF-8 cathode. This work will contribute to the improvement of the cathode materials of commercial LIB."

      "Quantitative electrolyte extraction from lithium ion batteries (LIB) is of great interest for recycling processes. Following the generally valid EU legal guidelines for the recycling of batteries, 50 wt % of a LIB cell has to be recovered, which cannot be achieved without the electrolyte; hence, the electrolyte represents a target component for the recycling of LIBs. Additionally, fluoride or fluorinated compounds, as inevitably present in LIB electrolytes, can hamper or even damage recycling processes in industry and have to be removed from the solid LIB parts, as well. Finally, extraction is a necessary tool for LIB electrolyte aging analysis as well as for post-mortem investigations in general, because a qualitative overview can already be achieved after a few minutes of extraction for well-aged, apparently \"dry\" LIB cells, where the electrolyte is deeply penetrated or even gellified in the solid battery materials."

      "Effective lithium-ion battery module modeling has become a bottleneck for full-size electric vehicle crash safety numerical simulation. Modeling every single cell in detail would be costly. However, computational accuracy could be lost if the module is modeled by using a simple bulk material or rigid body. To solve this critical engineering problem, a general method to establish a computational homogenized model for the cylindrical battery module is proposed. A single battery cell model is developed and validated through radial compression and bending experiments. To analyze the homogenized mechanical properties of the module, a representative unit cell (RUC) is extracted with the periodic boundary condition applied on it. An elastic-plastic constitutive model is established to describe the computational homogenized model for the module. Two typical packing modes, i.e., cubic dense packing and hexagonal packing for the homogenized equivalent battery module (EBM) model, are targeted for validation compression tests, as well as the models with detailed single cell description. Further, the homogenized EBM model is confirmed to agree reasonably well with the detailed battery module (DBM) model for different packing modes with a length scale of up to 15 × 15 cells and 12% deformation where the short circuit takes place. The suggested homogenized model for battery module makes way for battery module and pack safety evaluation for full-size electric vehicle crashworthiness analysis."

      "α-Fe2O3 nanomaterials with an elongated nanorod morphology exhibiting superior electrochemical performance were obtained through hydrothermal synthesis assisted by diamine derivatives as shape-controlling agents (SCAs) for application as anodes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The physicochemical characteristics were investigated via XRD and FESEM, revealing well-crystallized α-Fe2O3 with adjustable nanorod lengths between 240 and 400 nm and aspect ratios in the range from 2.6 to 5.7. The electrochemical performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge measurements. A SCA test series, including ethylenediamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, 2,3-diaminobutane, and N-methylethylenediamine, was implemented in terms of the impact on the nanorod aspect ratio. Varied substituents on the vicinal diamine structure were examined towards an optimized reaction center in terms of electron density and steric hindrance. Possible interaction mechanisms of the diamine derivatives with ferric species and the correlation between the aspect ratio and electrochemical performance are discussed. Intermediate-sized α-Fe2O3 nanorods with length/aspect ratios of ≈240 nm/≈2.6 and ≈280 nm/≈3.0 were found to have excellent electrochemical characteristics with reversible discharge capacities of 1086 and 1072 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C after 50 cycles."

      "Reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions are the key processes that underlie the batteries powering smartphones, laptops, and electric cars. A redox process involves transfer of electrons between two species. For example, in a lithium-ion battery, current is generated when conduction electrons from the lithium anode are transferred to the redox orbitals of the cathode material. The ability to visualize or image the redox orbitals and how these orbitals evolve under lithiation and delithiation processes is thus of great fundamental and practical interest for understanding the workings of battery materials. We show that inelastic scattering spectroscopy using high-energy x-ray photons (Compton scattering) can yield faithful momentum space images of the redox orbitals by considering lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4 or LFP) as an exemplar cathode battery material. Our analysis reveals a new link between voltage and the localization of transition metal 3d orbitals and provides insight into the puzzling mechanism of potential shift and how it is connected to the modification of the bond between the transition metal and oxygen atoms. Our study thus opens a novel spectroscopic pathway for improving the performance of battery materials."

      "The electrochemical performance of a battery is considered to be primarily dependent on the electrode material. However, engineering and optimization of electrodes also play a crucial role, and the same electrode material can be designed to offer significantly improved batteries. In this work, Si-Fe-Mn nanomaterial alloy (Si/alloy) and graphite composite electrodes were densified at different calendering conditions of 3, 5, and 8 tons, and its influence on electrode porosity, electrolyte wettability, and long-term cycling was investigated. The active material loading was maintained very high (~2 mg cm-2) to implement electrode engineering close to commercial loading scales. The densification was optimized to balance between the electrode thickness and wettability to enable the best electrochemical properties of the Si/alloy anodes. In this case, engineering and optimizing the Si/alloy composite electrodes to 3 ton calendering (electrode densification from 0.39 to 0.48 g cm-3) showed enhanced cycling stability with a high capacity retention of ~100% over 100 cycles."

      "Integration of bicomponents into a greater object or assemblage is a new avenue to acquire multifunctionality for metal oxide-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, we report a versatile means by which precursors serve as self-sacrificing templates to form architectures of SnO2 phase and other metal oxides. The vital challenge is the determination of appropriate synthetic system that can benefit the formation of respective precursors in a structure or single-source precursors of tin and other metal species. In the current work, by the aids of synergy action between l-proline and ethylene glycol (EG), precursors containing two metal ions are generally fabricated. Adequate flexibility of the present method has been achieved for SnO2/M x O y hierarchical hybrids, including Mn2O3, Co3O4, NiO, and Zn2SnO4, by calcination of their corresponding SnMn, SnCo, SnNi, and SnZn precursors, respectively. When evaluated as anode materials for LIBs, the obtained SnO2/Mn2O3 homogeneous hybrids, as expected, show higher specific capacity and ultralong cycling stability, gaining a reversible specific capacity of 610.3 mA h g-1 after 600 cycles with only decay of 0.29 mA h g-1 per cycle at 1 A g-1 and 487 mA h g-1 after 1001 cycles at a high current density of 2 A g-1."

      "Interfaces are essential in electrochemical processes, providing a critical nanoscopic design feature for composite electrodes used in Li-ion batteries. Understanding the structure, wetting and mobility at nano-confined interfaces is important for improving the efficiency and lifetime of electrochemical devices. Here we use a Surface Forces Apparatus to quantify the initial wetting of nanometre-confined graphene, gold and mica surfaces by Li-ion battery electrolytes. Our results indicate preferential wetting of confined graphene in comparison with gold or mica surfaces because of specific interactions of the electrolyte with the graphene surface. In addition, wetting of a confined pore proceeds via a profoundly different mechanism compared with wetting of a macroscopic surface. We further reveal the existence of molecularly layered structures of the confined electrolyte. Nanoscopic confinement of less than 4-5 nm and the presence of water decrease the mobility of the electrolyte. These results suggest a lower limit for the pore diameter in nanostructured electrodes."

      "Structural degradation and low conductivity of transition-metal oxides lead to severe capacity fading in lithium-ion batteries. Recent efforts to solve this issue have mainly focused on using nanocomposites or hybrids by integrating nanosized metal oxides with conducting additives. Here we design specific hierarchical structures and demonstrate their use in flexible, large-area anode assemblies. Fabrication of these anodes is achieved via oxidative growth of copper oxide nanowires onto copper substrates followed by radio-frequency sputtering of carbon-nitride films, forming freestanding three-dimensional arrays with core-shell nano-architecture. Cable-like copper oxide/carbon-nitride core-shell nanostructures accommodate the volume change during lithiation-delithiation processes, the three-dimensional arrays provide abundant electroactive zones and electron/ion transport paths, and the monolithic sandwich-type configuration without additional binders or conductive agents improves energy/power densities of the whole electrode."

      "Graphene oxide flexibly supported MoO2 porous architectures (MoO2/GO) by decomposition of the prepared ammonium molybdate/GO preforms is fabricated. Focused ion beam microscope analysis shows that the inside structures of the architectures strongly depend on the percentages of the GO used as flexible supports: micrometer scale MoO2 particulates growing on the GO (micrometer MoO2/GO), 3D honeycomb-like nanoarchitectures (MoO2/GO nanohoneycomb), and layered MoO2/GO architectures are achieved at the percentage of GO at 4.3, 15.2, and 20.8 wt%, respectively. The lithium storage performance of the MoO2/GO architectures strongly depends on their inside structures. At the current density of 100 mA g-1, the capacities of the micrometer MoO2/GO, MoO2/GO nanohoneycomb, and layered MoO2/GO remain at 901, 1127, and 967 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles. The average coulombic efficiencies of micrometer MoO2/GO, MoO2/GO nanohoneycomb, and layered MoO2/GO electrodes are 97.6%, 99.3%, and 99.0%. Moreover, the rate performance shows even cycled at a high current density of 5000 mA g-1, the MoO2/GO nanohoneycomb can deliver the capacity as high as 461 mAh g-1. The MoO2/GO nanohoneycomb exhibits best performance attributed to its unique nanohoneycomb structure constructed with ultrafine MoO2 fixed on the GO flexible supports."

      "A hierarchical mesoporous carbon foam (ECF) with an interconnected micro-/mesoporous architecture was prepared and used as a binder-free, low-cost, high-performance anode for lithium ion batteries. Due to its high specific surface area (980.6 m2/g), high porosity (99.6%), light weight (5 mg/cm3) and narrow pore size distribution (~2 to 5 nm), the ECF anode exhibited a high reversible specific capacity of 455 mAh/g. Experimental results also demonstrated that the anode thickness significantly influence the specific capacity of the battery. Meanwhile, the ECF anode retained a high rate performance and an excellent cycling performance approaching 100% of its initial capacity over 300 cycles at 0.1 A/g. In addition, no binders, carbon additives or current collectors are added to the ECF based cells that will increase the total weight of devices. The high electrochemical performance was mainly attributed to the combined favorable hierarchical structures which can facilitate the Li+ accessibility and also enable the fast diffusion of electron into the electrode during the charge and discharge process. The synthesis process used to make this elastic carbon foam is readily scalable to industrial applications in energy storage devices such as li-ion battery and supercapacitor."

      "This article provides the dataset of both the LiFePO4 type lithium-ion battery (LIB) behavior and the Maxwell ultracapacitor behavior. The dynamic stress test (DST) condition and the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) condition were carried out to analyze the battery/ultracapacitor features. The datasets were achieved at room temperature, in August, 2016. The shared data contributes to clarify the behavior of the LIBs and ultracapacitors and can be used to predict the state-of-charge (SOC) of the LIBs and ultracapacitors, which is also shown in the article of \"Modeling and state-of-charge prediction of lithium-ion battery and ultracapacitor hybrids with a co-estimator\" (United States Advanced Battery Consortium, 1996) [1]."

      "Cu2+1O coated Si nanoparticles were prepared by simple hydrolysis and were investigated as an anode material for lithium-ion battery. The coating of Cu2+1O on the surface of Si particles remarkably improves the cycle performance of the battery than that made by the pristine Si. The battery exhibits an initial reversible capacity of 3063 mAh/g and an initial coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82.9 %. With a current density of 300 mA/g, its reversible capacity can remains 1060 mAh/g after 350 cycles, corresponding to a CE ≥ 99.8 %. It is believed that the Cu2+1O coating enhances the electrical conductivity, and the elasticity of Cu2+1O further helps buffer the volume changes during lithiation/delithiation processes. Experiment results indicate that the electrode maintained a highly integrated structure after 100 cycles and it is in favour of the formation of stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the Si surface to keep the extremely high CE during long charge and discharge cycles."

      "Triple-shelled ZnFe2O4 hollow microspheres (ZFO) as anode materials for lithium ion battery are prepared through a one-pot hydrothermal reaction using the composite solution consisting of sucrose in water and metal ions in ethylene glycol (EG), followed by different calcination processes. The architectures of ZFO micro spheres are differently synthesized through a mutual cooperation of inward and outward ripening with three different calcination temperatures. Thin triple-shelled ZnFe2O4 hollow microspheres calcined at 450 °C (ZFO-450) delivers a high reversible capacity of 932 mA h g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1 even at the 200th cycle without obvious decay. Furthermore, ZFO-450 delivers 1235, 1005, 865, 834, and 845 mA h g-1 at high current densities of 0.5, 2, 5, 10, and 20 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Thin triple-shelled hollow microsphere prepared at an optimum calcination temperature provides exceptional rate capability and outstanding rate retention due to (i) the formation of nanoparticles leading to thin shell with morphological integrity, (ii) the facile mass transfer by thin shell with mesoporous structure, and (iii) the void space with macroporous structure alleviating volume change occurring during cycling."

      "Fast lithium ion and electron transport inside electrode materials are essential to realize its superb electrochemical performances for lithium rechargeable batteries. Herein, a distinctive structure of cathode material is proposed, which can simultaneously satisfy these requirements. Nanosized Li3V2(PO4)3 (LVP) particles can be successfully grown up on the carbon nanofiber via electrospinning method followed by a controlled heat-treatment. Herein, LVP particles are anchored onto the surface of carbon nanofiber, and with this growing process, the size of LVP particles as well as the thickness of carbon nanofiber can be regulated together. The morphological features of this composite structure enable not only direct contact between electrolytes and LVP particles that can enhance lithium ion diffusivity, but also fast electron transport through 1D carbon network along nanofibers simultaneously. Finally, it is demonstrated that this unique structure is an ideal one to realize high electron transport and ion diffusivity together, which are essential for enhancing the electrochemical performances of electrode materials."

      "A simple and practicable evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method is introduced for the first time to prepare nanosized solid electrolyte Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (LATP) for all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. A pure Na+ super ion conductor (NASICON) phase is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and its primary particle size is down to 70 nm by optimizing evaporation rate of the solvent. Excellent room temperature bulk and total lithium-ion conductivities of 2.09 × 10-3 S cm-1 and 3.63 × 10-4 S cm-1 are obtained, with an ion-hopping activation energy as low as 0.286 eV."

      "Highlighted by the safe operation and stable performances, titanium oxides (TiO2) are deemed as promising candidates for next generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the pervasively low capacity is casting shadow on desirable electrochemical behaviors and obscuring their practical applications. In this work, we reported a unique template-assisted and two-step atomic layer deposition (ALD) method to achieve TiO2@Fe2O3 core-shell nanotube arrays with hollow interior and double-wall coating. The as-prepared architecture combines both merits of the high specific capacity of Fe2O3 and structural stability of TiO2 backbone. Owing to the nanotubular structural advantages integrating facile strain relaxation as well as rapid ion and electron transport, the TiO2@Fe2O3 nanotube arrays with a high mass loading of Fe2O3 attained desirable capacity of ~520 mA h g-1, exhibiting both good rate capability under uprated current density of 10 A g-1 and especially enhanced cycle stability (~450 mA h g-1 after 600 cycles), outclassing most reported TiO2@metal oxide composites. The results not only provide a new avenue for hybrid core-shell nanotube formation, but also offer an insight for rational design of advanced electrode materials for LIBs."

      "Binary transition metal oxides have been regarded as one of the most promising candidates for high-performance electrodes in energy storage devices, since they can offer high electrochemical activity and high capacity. Rational designing nanosized metal oxide/carbon composite architectures has been proven to be an effective way to improve the electrochemical performance. In this work, the (Co,Mn)3O4 spinel was synthesized and anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets using a facile and single hydrothermal step with H2O2 as additive, no further additional calcination required. Analysis showed that this method gives a mixed spinel, i.e. (Co,Mn)3O4, having 2+ and 3+ Co and Mn ions in both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of the spinel structure, with a nanocubic morphology roughly 20 nm in size. The nanocubes are bound onto the rGO nanosheet uniformly in a single hydrothermal process, then the as-prepared (Co,Mn)3O4/rGO composite was characterized as the anode materials for Li-ion battery (LIB). It can deliver 1130.6 mAh g-1 at current density of 100 mA g-1 with 98% of coulombic efficiency after 140 cycles. At 1000 mA g-1, the capacity can still maintain 750 mAh g-1, demonstrating excellent rate capabilities. Therefore, the one-step process is a facile and promising method to fabricate metal oxide/rGO composite materials for energy storage applications."

      "High-voltage lithium-ion batteries (HVLIBs) are considered as promising devices of energy storage for electric vehicle, hybrid electric vehicle, and other high-power equipment. HVLIBs require their own platform voltages to be higher than 4.5 V on charge. Lithium nickel manganese spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode is the most promising candidate among the 5 V cathode materials for HVLIBs due to its flat plateau at 4.7 V. However, the degradation of cyclic performance is very serious when LNMO cathode operates over 4.2 V. In this review, we summarize some methods for enhancing the cycling stability of LNMO cathodes in lithium-ion batteries, including doping, cathode surface coating, electrolyte modifying, and other methods. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different methods."

      "Lithium-ion battery performance is intrinsically linked to electrode microstructure. Quantitative measurement of key structural parameters of lithium-ion battery electrode microstructures will enable optimization as well as motivate systematic numerical studies for the improvement of battery performance. With the rapid development of 3-D imaging techniques, quantitative assessment of 3-D microstructures from 2-D image sections by stereological methods appears outmoded; however, in spite of the proliferation of tomographic imaging techniques, it remains significantly easier to obtain two-dimensional (2-D) data sets. In this study, stereological prediction and three-dimensional (3-D) analysis techniques for quantitative assessment of key geometric parameters for characterizing battery electrode microstructures are examined and compared. Lithium-ion battery electrodes were imaged using synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy. For each electrode sample investigated, stereological analysis was performed on reconstructed 2-D image sections generated from tomographic imaging, whereas direct 3-D analysis was performed on reconstructed image volumes. The analysis showed that geometric parameter estimation using 2-D image sections is bound to be associated with ambiguity and that volume-based 3-D characterization of nonconvex, irregular and interconnected particles can be used to more accurately quantify spatially-dependent parameters, such as tortuosity and pore-phase connectivity."

      "Li-ion battery, separator, multicoreshell structure, thermal stability, long-term stability. A nanofibrous membrane with multiple cores of polyimide (PI) in the shell of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) was prepared using a facile one-pot electrospinning technique with a single nozzle. Unique multicore-shell (MCS) structure of the electrospun composite fibers was obtained, which resulted from electrospinning a phase-separated polymer composite solution. Multiple PI core fibrils with high molecular orientation were well-embedded across the cross-section and contributed remarkable thermal stabilities to the MCS membrane. Thus, no outbreaks were found in its dimension and ionic resistance up to 200 and 250 °C, respectively. Moreover, the MCS membrane (at ~200 °C), as a lithium ion battery (LIB) separator, showed superior thermal and electrochemical stabilities compared with a widely used commercial separator (~120 °C). The average capacity decay rate of LIB for 500 cycles was calculated to be approximately 0.030 mAh/g/cycle. This value demonstrated exceptional long-term stability compared with commercial LIBs and with two other types (single core-shell and co-electrospun separators incorporating with functionalized TiO2) of PI/PVdF composite separators. The proper architecture and synergy effects of multiple PI nanofibrils as a thermally stable polymer in the PVdF shell as electrolyte compatible polymers are responsible for the superior thermal performance and long-term stability of the LIB."

      "In order to reduce the amount of inactive materials, such as binders and carbon additives in battery electrode, porous cobalt monoxide nanofibers were directly grown on conductive substrate as a binder/additive-free lithium-ion battery anode. This electrode exhibited very high specific discharging/charging capacities at various rates and good cycling stability. It was promising as high capacity anode materials for lithium-ion battery."

      "Despite numerous studies presenting advances in tomographic imaging and analysis of lithium ion batteries, graphite-based anodes have received little attention. Weak X-ray attenuation of graphite and, as a result, poor contrast between graphite and the other carbon-based components in an electrode pore space renders data analysis challenging. Here we demonstrate operando tomography of weakly attenuating electrodes during electrochemical (de)lithiation. We use propagation-based phase contrast tomography to facilitate the differentiation between weakly attenuating materials and apply digital volume correlation to capture the dynamics of the electrodes during operation. After validating that we can quantify the local electrochemical activity and microstructural changes throughout graphite electrodes, we apply our technique to graphite-silicon composite electrodes. We show that microstructural changes that occur during (de)lithiation of a pure graphite electrode are of the same order of magnitude as spatial inhomogeneities within it, while strain in composite electrodes is locally pronounced and introduces significant microstructural changes."

      "Optimizing the desired properties for stretch monolayer separators used in Lithium-ion batteries has been a challenge. In the present study a cellulose nanofiber/PET nonwoven composite separator is successfully fabricated, using a wet-laid nonwoven (papermaking) process, which can attain optimal properties in wettability, mechanical strength, thermal resistance, and electrochemical performance simultaneously. The PET nonwoven material, which is fabricated from ultrafine PET fibers by a wet-laid process, is a mechanical support layer. The porous structure of the composite separator was created by cellulose nanofibers coating the PET in a papermaking process. Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), which are an eco-friendly sustainable resource, have been drawing considerable attention due to their astounding properties, such as: incredible specific surface area, thermal and chemical stability, high mechanical strength and hydrophilicity. The results show that the CNF separator exhibits higher porosity (70%) than a PP (polypropylene) separator (40%). The CNF separator can also be wetted by electrolyte in a few seconds while a PP separator cannot be entirely wetted after 1 min. The CNF separator has an electrolyte uptake of 250%, while a PP separator has only 65%. Another notable finding is that the CNF separator has almost no shrinkage when exposed to 180 °C for 1 h, whereas a PP separator shrinks by more than 50%. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) shows that the CNF separator has a higher melting point than a PP separator. These findings all indicate that the CNF 29 separator will be more favorable than stretch film for use in Lithium-ion batteries."

      "Electric vehicles using lithium-ion battery pack(s) for propulsion have recently attracted a great deal of interest. The large-scale practical application of battery electric vehicles may not be realized unless lithium-ion batteries with self-charging suppliers will be developed. Solar cells offer an attractive option for directly photo-charging lithium-ion batteries. Here we demonstrate the use of perovskite solar cell packs with four single CH3NH3PbI3 based solar cells connected in series for directly photo-charging lithium-ion batteries assembled with a LiFePO4 cathode and a Li4Ti5O12 anode. Our device shows a high overall photo-electric conversion and storage efficiency of 7.80% and excellent cycling stability, which outperforms other reported lithium-ion batteries, lithium-air batteries, flow batteries and super-capacitors integrated with a photo-charging component. The newly developed self-chargeable units based on integrated perovskite solar cells and lithium-ion batteries hold promise for various potential applications."

      "A novel network of spindle-like carbon nanofibers was fabricated via a simplified synthesis involving electrospinning followed by preoxidation in air and postcarbonization in Ar. Not only was the as-obtained carbon network comprised of beads of spindle-like nanofibers but the cubic MnO phase and N elements were successfully anchored into the amorphous carbon matrix. When directly used as a binder-free anode for lithium-ion batteries, the network showed excellent electrochemical performance with high capacity, good rate capacity and reliable cycling stability. Under a current density of 0.2 A g-1, it delivered a high reversible capacity of 875.5 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles and 1005.5 mAh g-1 after 250 cycles with a significant coulombic efficiency of 99.5%."

      "Graphene is composed of a single atomic layer of carbon which has excellent mechanical, electrical and optical properties. It has the potential to be widely used in the fields of physics, chemistry, information, energy and device manufacturing. In this paper, we briefly review the concept, structure, properties, preparation methods of graphene and its application in lithium ion batteries. A continuous 3D conductive network formed by graphene can effectively improve the electron and ion transportation of the electrode materials, so the addition of graphene can greatly enhance lithium ion battery's properties and provide better chemical stability, higher electrical conductivity and higher capacity. In this review, some recent advances in the graphene-containing materials used in lithium ion batteries are summarized and future prospects are highlighted."

      "A novel Si/Sn composite anode material with unique ribbon structure was synthesized by Mechanical Milling (MM) and the structural transformation was studied in the present work. The microstructure characterization shows that Si/Sn composite with idealized entangled ribbon structured can be obtained by milling the mixture of the starting materials, Si and Sn for 20 h. According to the calculated results based on the XRD data, the as-milled 20 h sample has the smallest avergae crystalline size. It is supposed that the flexible ribbon structure allows for accommodation of intrinsic damage, which significantly improves the fracture toughness of the composite. The charge and discharge tests of the as-milled 20 h sample have been performed with reference to Li(+)/Li at a current density of 400 mA g(-1) in the voltage from 1.5 to 0.03 V (vs Li/Li(+)) and the result shows that the initial capacity is ∼1400 mA h g(-1), with a retention of ∼1100 mA h g(-1) reversible capacity after 50 cycles, which is possible serving as the promising anode material for the lithium ion battery application."

      "Composite electrodes containing active materials, carbon and binder are widely used in lithium-ion batteries. Since the electrode reaction occurs preferentially in regions with lower resistance, reaction distribution can be happened within composite electrodes. We investigate the relationship between the reaction distribution with depth direction and electronic/ionic conductivity in composite electrodes with changing electrode porosities. Two dimensional X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that the reaction distribution is happened in lower porosity electrodes. Our developed 6-probe method can measure electronic/ionic conductivity in composite electrodes. The ionic conductivity is decreased for lower porosity electrodes, which governs the reaction distribution of composite electrodes and their performances."

      "A novel one-step hydrothermal and calcination strategy was developed to synthesize the unique 1D oriented Co3O4 crystal nanofibers with (220) facets on the carbon matrix derived from the natural, abundant and low cost wool fibers acting as both carbon precursor and template reagent. The resultant W2@Co3O4 nanocomposite exhibited very high specific capacity and favorable high-rate capability when used as anode material of lithium ion battery. The high reversible Li(+) ion storage capacity of 986 mAh g(-1) was obtained at 100 mA g(-1) after 150 cycles, higher than the theoretical capacity of Co3O4 (890 mAh g(-1)). Even at the higher current density of 1 A g(-1), the electrode could still deliver a remarkable discharge capacity of 720 mAh g(-1) over 150 cycles."

      "The increasing demand of emerging technologies for high energy density electrochemical storage has led many researchers to look for alternative anode materials to graphite. The most promising conversion and alloying materials do not yet possess acceptable cycle life or rate capability. In this work, we use tin oxide, SnO2, as a representative anode material to explore the influence of graphene incorporation and In-doping to increase the electronic conductivity and concomitantly improve capacity retention and cycle life. It was found that the incorporation of In into SnO2 reduces the charge transfer resistance during cycling, prolonging life. It is also hypothesized that the increased conductivity allows the tin oxide conversion and alloying reactions to both be reversible, leading to very high capacity near 1200 mAh/g. Finally, the electrodes show excellent rate capability with a capacity of over 200 mAh/g at 10C."

      "Lack of high-performance cathode materials has become the major barriers to lithium-ion battery applications in advanced communication equipment and electric vehicles. In this paper, we report a versatile interfacial reaction strategy, which is based on the idea of space confinement, for the synthesis of ultradispersed LiV3O8 nanoparticles (~10 nm) on graphene (denoted as LVO NPs-GNs) with an unprecedented degree of control on the separation and manipulation of the nucleation, growth, anchoring, and crystallization of nanoparticles in a water-in-oil emulsion system over free growth in solution. The prepared LVO NPs-GNs composites displayed high performance as an cathode material for lithium-ion battery, including high reversible lithium storage capacity (237 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles), high Coulombic efficiency (about 98%), excellent cycling stability and high rate capability (as high as 176 mA h g(-1) at 0.9 A g(-1), 128 mA h g(-1) at 1.5 A g(-1), 91 mA h g(-1) at 3 A g(-1) and 59 mA h g(-1) at 6 A g(-1), respectively). Very significantly, the preparation method employed can be easily adapted and may opens the door to complex hybrid materials design and engineering with graphene for advanced energy storage."

      "Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has evolved as an important technique to coat conformal protective thin films on cathode and anode particles of lithium ion batteries to enhance their electrochemical performance. Coating a conformal, conductive and optimal ultrathin film on cathode particles has significantly increased the capacity retention and cycle life as demonstrated in our previous work. In this work, we have unearthed the synergetic effect of electrochemically active iron oxide films coating and partial doping of iron on LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 (LMNO) particles. The ionic Fe penetrates into the lattice structure of LMNO during the ALD process. After the structural defects were saturated, the iron started participating in formation of ultrathin oxide films on LMNO particle surface. Owing to the conductive nature of iron oxide films, with an optimal film thickness of ~0.6 nm, the initial capacity improved by ~25% at room temperature and by ~26% at an elevated temperature of 55 °C at a 1C cycling rate. The synergy of doping of LMNO with iron combined with the conductive and protective nature of the optimal iron oxide film led to a high capacity retention (~93% at room temperature and ~91% at 55 °C) even after 1,000 cycles at a 1C cycling rate."

      "A superfine Li0.33La0.557TiO₃ (LLTO, 69.4 nm) was successfully synthesized by a facile solvent-thermal method to enhance the electrochemical properties of the lithium-ion battery separator. Co-axial nanofiber of cellulose and Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) was prepared by a co-axial electrospinning technique, in which the shell material was PVDF-HFP and the core was cellulose. LLTO superfine nanoparticles were incorporated into the shell of the PVDF-HFP. The core-shell composite nanofibrous membrane showed good wettability (16.5°, contact angle), high porosity (69.77%), and super electrolyte compatibility (497%, electrolyte uptake). It had a higher ionic conductivity (13.897 mS·cm-1) than those of pure polymer fibrous membrane and commercial separator. In addition, the rate capability (155.56 mAh·g-1) was also superior to the compared separator. These excellent performances endowed LLTO composite nanofibrous membrane as a promising separator for high-performance lithium-ion batteries."

      "We report a facile synthesis of a novel cobalt oxide (Co3O4) hierarchical nanostructure, in which crystalline core-amorphous shell Co3O4 nanoparticles with a bimodal size distribution are uniformly dispersed on ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets. When tested as anode materials for lithium ion batteries, the as-prepared Co3O4 hierarchical electrodes delivered high lithium storage properties comparing to the other Co3O4 nanostructures, including a high reversible capacity of 1053.1 mAhg(-1) after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.2 C (1 C = 890 mAg(-1)), good cycling stability and rate capability."

      "3D annealed SnO2/graphene sheet foams (ASGFs) are synthesized by in situ self-assembly of graphene sheets prepared by mild chemical reduction. L-ascorbyl acid is used to effectively reduce the SnO2 nanoparticles/graphene oxide colloidal solution and form the 3D conductive graphene networks. The annealing treatment contributes to the formation of the Sn-O-C bonds between the SnO2 nanoparticles and the reduced graphene sheets, which improves the electrochemical performance of the foams. The ASGF has features of typical aerogels: low density (about 19 mg cm(-3)), smooth surface and porous structure. The ASGF anodes exhibit good specific capacity, excellent cycling stability and superior rate capability. The first reversible specific capacity is as high as 984.2 mAh g(-1) at a specific current of 200 mA g(-1). Even at the high specific current of 1000 mA g(-1) after 150 cycles, the reversible specific capacity of ASGF is still as high as 533.7 mAh g(-1), about twice as much as that of SGF (297.6 mAh g(-1)) after the same test. This synthesis method can be scaled up to prepare other metal oxides particles/ graphene sheet foams for high performance lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and catalysts, etc."

      "Graphene is extensively investigated and promoted as a viable replacement for graphite, the state-of-the-art material for lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes, although no clear evidence is available about improvements in terms of cycling stability, delithiation voltage and volumetric capacity. Here we report the microwave-assisted synthesis of a novel graphene-based material in ionic liquid (i.e., carved multilayer graphene with nested Fe3O4 nanoparticles), together with its extensive characterization via several physical and chemical techniques. When such a composite material is used as LIB anode, the carved paths traced by the Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and the unconverted metallic iron formed in-situ upon the 1(st) lithiation, result in enhanced rate capability and, especially at high specific currents (i.e., 5 A g(-1)), remarkable cycling stability (99% of specific capacity retention after 180 cycles), low average delithiation voltage (0.244 V) and a substantially increased volumetric capacity with respect to commercial graphite (58.8 Ah L(-1) vs. 9.6 Ah L(-1))."

      "Two α-MnO2 crystals with caddice-clew-like and urchin-like morphologies are prepared by the hydrothermal method, and their structure and electrochemical performance are characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), galvanostatic cell cycling, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The morphology of the MnO2 prepared under acidic condition is urchin-like, while the one prepared under neutral condition is caddice-clew-like. The identical crystalline phase of MnO2 crystals is essential to evaluate the relationship between electrochemical performances and morphologies for lithium-ion battery application. In this study, urchin-like α-MnO2 crystals with compact structure have better electrochemical performance due to the higher specific capacity and lower impedance. We find that the relationship between electrochemical performance and morphology is different when MnO2 material used as electrochemical supercapacitor or as anode of lithium-ion battery. For lithium-ion battery application, urchin-like MnO2 material has better electrochemical performance."

      "The distribution of cations in Li-ion battery cathodes as a function of cycling is a pivotal characteristic of battery performance. The transition metal cation distribution has been shown to affect cathode performance; however, Li is notoriously challenging to characterize with typical imaging techniques. Here laser-assisted atom probe tomography (APT) is used to map the three-dimensional distribution of Li at a sub-nanometre spatial resolution and correlate it with the distribution of the transition metal cations (M) and the oxygen. As-fabricated layered Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 is shown to have Li-rich Li2MO3 phase regions and Li-depleted Li(Ni0.5Mn0.5)O2 regions. Cycled material has an overall loss of Li in addition to Ni-, Mn- and Li-rich regions. Spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 is shown to have a uniform distribution of all cations. APT results were compared to energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping with a scanning transmission electron microscope to confirm the transition metal cation distribution."

      "We demonstrate a new design of Ge-based electrodes comprising three-dimensional (3-D) spherical microflowers containing crystalline nanorod networks on sturdy 1-D nanostems directly grown on a metallic current collector by facile thermal evaporation. The Ge nanorod networks were observed to self-replicate their tetrahedron structures and form a diamond cubic lattice-like inner network. After etching and subsequent carbon coating, the treated Ge nanostructures provide good electrical conductivity and are resistant to gradual deterioration, resulting in superior electrochemical performance as anode materials for LIBs, with a charge capacity retention of 96% after 100 cycles and a high specific capacity of 1360 mA h g(-1) at 1 C and a high-rate capability with reversible capacities of 1080 and 850 mA h g(-1) at the rates of 5 and 10 C, respectively. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the fast electron transport and good strain accommodation of the carbon-filled Ge microflower-on-nanostem hybrid electrode."

      "Degradation mechanisms such as lithium plating, growth of the passivated surface film layer on the electrodes and loss of both recyclable lithium ions and electrode material adversely affect the longevity of the lithium ion battery. The anode electrode is very vulnerable to these degradation mechanisms. In this paper, the most common aging mechanisms occurring at the anode during the operation of the lithium battery, as well as some approaches for minimizing the degradation are reviewed."

      "Silicon is receiving discernable attention as an active material for next generation lithium-ion battery anodes because of its unparalleled gravimetric capacity. However, the large volume change of silicon over charge-discharge cycles weakens its competitiveness in the volumetric energy density and cycle life. Here we report direct graphene growth over silicon nanoparticles without silicon carbide formation. The graphene layers anchored onto the silicon surface accommodate the volume expansion of silicon via a sliding process between adjacent graphene layers. When paired with a commercial lithium cobalt oxide cathode, the silicon carbide-free graphene coating allows the full cell to reach volumetric energy densities of 972 and 700 Wh l(-1) at first and 200th cycle, respectively, 1.8 and 1.5 times higher than those of current commercial lithium-ion batteries. This observation suggests that two-dimensional layered structure of graphene and its silicon carbide-free integration with silicon can serve as a prototype in advancing silicon anodes to commercially viable technology."

      "Germanium is an outstanding anode material in terms of electrochemical performance, especially rate capability, but its developments are hindered by its high price because it is rare in the crust of earth, and its huge volume variation during the lithium insertion and extraction. Introducing other cheaper elements into the germanium-based material is an efficient way to dilute the high price, but normally sacrifice its electrochemical performance. By the combination of nanostructure design and cheap element (calcium) introduction, urchin-like Ca2Ge7O16 hierarchical hollow microspheres have been successfully developed in order to reduce the price and maintain the good electrochemical properties of germanium-based material. The electrochemical test results in different electrolytes show that ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate (3/4/3 by volume) with 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate additive is the most suitable solvent for the electrolyte. From the electrochemical evaluation, the as-synthesized Ca2Ge7O16 hollow microspheres exhibit high reversible specific capacity of up to 804.6 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles and remarkable rate capability of 341.3 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 4 A g(-1). The growth mechanism is proposed based on our experimental results on the growth process."

      "The investigation of chemical and structural dynamics in battery materials is essential to elucidation of structure-property relationships for rational design of advanced battery materials. Spatially resolved techniques, such as scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), are widely applied to address this challenge. However, battery materials are susceptible to electron beam damage, complicating the data interpretation. In this study, we demonstrate that, under electron beam irradiation, the surface and bulk of battery materials undergo chemical and structural evolution equivalent to that observed during charge-discharge cycling. In a lithiated NiO nanosheet, a Li2CO3-containing surface reaction layer (SRL) was gradually decomposed during electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) acquisition. For cycled LiNi(0.4)Mn(0.4)Co(0.18)Ti(0.02)O2 particles, repeated electron beam irradiation induced a phase transition from an layered structure to an rock-salt structure, which is attributed to the stoichiometric lithium and oxygen removal from 3a and 6c sites, respectively. Nevertheless, it is still feasible to preserve pristine chemical environments by minimizing electron beam damage, for example, using fast electron imaging and spectroscopy. Finally, the present study provides examples of electron beam damage on lithium-ion battery materials and suggests that special attention is necessary to prevent misinterpretation of experimental results."

      "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have displayed great potential as anode materials for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) due to their unique structural, mechanical, and electrical properties. The measured reversible lithium ion capacities of CNT-based anodes are considerably improved compared to the conventional graphite-based anodes. Additionally, the opened structure and enriched chirality of CNTs can help to improve the capacity and electrical transport in CNT-based LIBs. Therefore, the modification of CNTs and design of CNT structure provide strategies for improving the performance of CNT-based anodes. CNTs could also be assembled into free-standing electrodes without any binder or current collector, which will lead to increased specific energy density for the overall battery design. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of lithium ion intercalation and diffusion in CNTs, and the influence of different structures and morphologies on their performance as anode materials for LIBs."

      "Organic batteries free of toxic metal species could lead to a new generation of consumer energy storage devices that are safe and environmentally benign. However, the conventional organic electrodes remain problematic because of their structural instability, slow ion-diffusion dynamics, and poor electrical conductivity. Here, we report on the development of a redox-active, crystalline, mesoporous covalent organic framework (COF) on carbon nanotubes for use as electrodes; the electrode stability is enhanced by the covalent network, the ion transport is facilitated by the open meso-channels, and the electron conductivity is boosted by the carbon nanotube wires. These effects work synergistically for the storage of energy and provide lithium-ion batteries with high efficiency, robust cycle stability, and high rate capability. Our results suggest that redox-active COFs on conducting carbons could serve as a unique platform for energy storage and may facilitate the design of new organic electrodes for high-performance and environmentally benign battery devices."

      "An innovative and environmentally friendly battery chemistry is proposed for high power applications. A carbon-coated ZnFe2O4 nanoparticle-based anode and a LiFePO4-multiwalled carbon nanotube-based cathode, both aqueous processed with Na-carboxymethyl cellulose, are combined, for the first time, in a Li-ion full cell with exceptional electrochemical performance. Such novel battery shows remarkable rate capabilities, delivering 50% of its nominal capacity at currents corresponding to ≈20C (with respect to the limiting cathode). Furthermore, the pre-lithiation of the negative electrode offers the possibility of tuning the cell potential and, therefore, achieving remarkable gravimetric energy and power density values of 202 Wh kg(-1) and 3.72 W kg(-1), respectively, in addition to grant a lithium reservoir. The high reversibility of the system enables sustaining more than 10 000 cycles at elevated C-rates (≈10C with respect to the LiFePO4 cathode), while retaining up to 85% of its initial capacity."

      "A facile process is demonstrated for the synthesis of layered SiCN-MoS2 structure via pyrolysis of polysilazane functionalized MoS2 flakes. The layered morphology and polymer to ceramic transformation on MoS2 surfaces was confirmed by use of electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. Tested as thick film electrode in a Li-ion battery half-cell, SiCN-MoS2 showed the classical three-stage reaction with improved cycling stability and capacity retention than neat MoS2. Contribution of conversion reaction of Li/MoS2 system on overall capacity was marginally affected by the presence of SiCN while Li-irreversibility arising from electrolyte decomposition was greatly suppressed. This is understood as one of the reasons for decreased first cycle loss and increased capacity retention. SiCN-MoS2 in the form of self-supporting paper electrode (at 6 mg·cm(-2)) exhibited even better performance, regaining initial charge capacity of approximately 530 mAh·g(-1) when the current density returned to 100 mA·g(-1) after continuous cycling at 2400 mA·g(-1) (192 mAh·g(-1)). MoS2 cycled electrode showed mud-cracks and film delamination whereas SiCN-MoS2 electrodes were intact and covered with a uniform solid electrolyte interphase coating. Taken together, our results suggest that molecular level interfacing with precursor-derived SiCN is an effective strategy for suppressing the metal-sulfide/electrolyte degradation reaction at low discharge potentials."

      "Separators with high reliability and security are in urgent demand for the advancement of high performance lithium ion batteries. Here, we present a new and practical porous membrane with three-dimension (3D) heat-resistant skeleton and high curvature pore structure as a promising separator candidate to facilitate advances in battery safety and performances beyond those obtained from the conventional separators. The unique material properties combining with the well-developed structural characteristics enable the 3D porous skeleton to own several favorable properties, including superior thermal stability, good wettability with liquid electrolyte, high ion conductivity and internal short-circuit protection function, etc. which give rise to acceptable battery performances. Considering the simply and cost-effective preparation process, the porous membrane is deemed to be an interesting direction for the future lithium ion battery separator."

      "A well-designed nanostructure CNT@TiO2-C with fine anatase TiO2 particle (< 8 nm), good electronic conducting network (inner CNT core and outer carbon layer), and mesoporous structure was prepared by a simple and green one-pot hydrothermal reaction. The utilization of glucose in the hydrothermal process not only solves the interfacial incompatibility between CNTs and titanate sol and controls the nucleation and growth of TiO2 particles, but also introduces a uniform, glucose-derived, carbon-layer on the TiO2 particles. The nanosized TiO2 particle, high conducting network, and interconnected nanopores of the CNT@TiO2-C nanocable greatly improve its electrochemical performances, especially rate capability. The CNT@TiO2-C nanocables show remarkable rate capability with reversible charge capacity of 297, 240, 210,178 and 127 mAh g(-1) at 1C, 5C, 10C, 20C and 50C, respectively, as well as excellent high rate cycling stability with capacity retention of 87% after 2000 cycles at 50C."

      "Current lithium batteries operate on inorganic insertion compounds to power a diverse range of applications, but recently there is a surging demand to develop environmentally friendly green electrode materials. To develop sustainable and eco-friendly lithium ion batteries, we report reversible lithium ion storage properties of a naturally occurring and abundant organic compound purpurin, which is non-toxic and derived from the plant madder. The carbonyl/hydroxyl groups present in purpurin molecules act as redox centers and reacts electrochemically with Li-ions during the charge/discharge process. The mechanism of lithiation of purpurin is fully elucidated using NMR, UV and FTIR spectral studies. The formation of the most favored six membered binding core of lithium ion with carbonyl groups of purpurin and hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-4 positions respectively facilitated lithiation process, whereas hydroxyl group at C-2 position remains unaltered."

      "A sustainable, heat-resistant and flame-retardant cellulose-based composite nonwoven has been successfully fabricated and explored its potential application for promising separator of high-performance lithium ion battery. It was demonstrated that this flame-retardant cellulose-based composite separator possessed good flame retardancy, superior heat tolerance and proper mechanical strength. As compared to the commercialized polypropylene (PP) separator, such composite separator presented improved electrolyte uptake, better interface stability and enhanced ionic conductivity. In addition, the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2)/graphite cell using this composite separator exhibited better rate capability and cycling retention than that for PP separator owing to its facile ion transport and excellent interfacial compatibility. Furthermore, the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4)/lithium cell with such composite separator delivered stable cycling performance and thermal dimensional stability even at an elevated temperature of 120°C. All these fascinating characteristics would boost the application of this composite separator for high-performance lithium ion battery."

      "Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in the field of new energy vehicles and energy storage. Understanding the electrode reaction of lithium-ion batteries is the key to improve their cycle life and safety. Direct measurement of thermodynamic data of the electrode reaction is a practical, economical, and nondestructive method for electrode characterization. In this paper, the open-circuit voltage of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li half-cell is measured at different discharge states and different temperatures. The dE/dT-SOD (state of discharge) relation curves are fitted linearly by the least square method, and the entropy change values of different SODs are calculated. Finally, the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy change of different SODs are obtained. The electrode reaction of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 in different SODs was discussed by the entropy change in different SODs. According to the evolution trend of ΔS, the lithium intercalation reaction of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 may be a single-phase solid solution reaction rather than a two-phase reaction. Finally, the reversible heat generation at different current values and SODs are calculated."

      "BACKGROUND: Belt or wire shaped TiO2(B) particles were synthesized for lithium ion battery application by a hydrothermal and heat treatment process. In order to facilitate TiO2(B)/C composites fabrication, the synthesized TiO2(B) particles were crushed into smaller sizes by ball milling. RESULTS: Ball mill treated TiO2(B) particles of less than 1.0 μm with a fraction of anatase phase, compared to as-synthesized TiO2(B) particles with about 24 μm in average particle size, showed a significant improvement in the electrochemical properties. They showed a much improved stability in the charge-discharge cycles and irreversibility. They maintained about 98% of the initial capacity during 50 cycles while as-synthesized sample before ball mill treatment showed a gradual decrease in the capacity with the cycles. The irreversibility of 12.4% of as-synthesized sample was also greatly improved to 7% after ball milling treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate ball mill treatment can be an economical way to improve electrochemical properties of TiO2(B) anode materials for lithium ion battery application."

      "We discuss the latest developments in alternative battery systems based on sodium, magnesium, zinc and aluminum. In each case, we categorize the individual metals by the overarching cathode material type, focusing on the energy storage mechanism. Specifically, sodium-ion batteries are the closest in technology and chemistry to today's lithium-ion batteries. This lowers the technology transition barrier in the short term, but their low specific capacity creates a long-term problem. The lower reactivity of magnesium makes pure Mg metal anodes much safer than alkali ones. However, these are still reactive enough to be deactivated over time. Alloying magnesium with different metals can solve this problem. Combining this with different cathodes gives good specific capacities, but with a lower voltage (<1.3 V, compared with 3.8 V for Li-ion batteries). Zinc has the lowest theoretical specific capacity, but zinc metal anodes are so stable that they can be used without alterations. This results in comparable capacities to the other materials and can be immediately used in systems where weight is not a problem. Theoretically, aluminum is the most promising alternative, with its high specific capacity thanks to its three-electron redox reaction. However, the trade-off between stability and specific capacity is a problem. After analyzing each option separately, we compare them all via a political, economic, socio-cultural and technological (PEST) analysis. The review concludes with recommendations for future applications in the mobile and stationary power sectors."

      "Solid composite electrolytes (SCEs) that combine the advantages of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) and inorganic ceramic electrolytes (ICEs) present acceptable ionic conductivity, high mechanical strength, and favorable interfacial contact with electrodes, which greatly improve the electrochemical performance of all-solid-state batteries compared to single SPEs and ICEs. However, there are many challenges to overcome before the practical application of SCEs, including the low ionic conductivity less than 10-3 S cm-1 at ambient temperature, poor interfacial stability, and high interfacial resistance, which greatly restrict the room temperature performance. Herein, the advances of SCEs applied in all-solid-state lithium batteries are presented, including the Li ion migration mechanism of SCEs, the strategies to enhance the ionic conductivity of SCEs by various morphologies of ICEs, and construction methods of the low resistance and stable interfaces of SCEs with both cathode and anode. Finally, some typical applications of SCEs in lithium batteries are summarized and future development directions are prospected. This work presents how it is quite significant to further enhance the ionic conductivity of SCEs by developing the novel SPEs with the special morphology of ICEs for advanced all-solid-state lithium batteries."

      "Commercial micrometer silicon (Si) powder was investigated as a potential anode material for lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries. The characterization of this powder showed the mean particle size of approx.75.2 nm, BET surface area of 10.6 m2/g and average pore size of 0.56 nm. Its band gap was estimated to 1.35 eV as determined using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra. In order to increase the surface area and porosity which is important for Li-ion batteries, the starting Si powder was ball-milled and threatened by metal-assisted chemical etching. The mechanochemical treatment resulted in decrease of the particle size from 75 nm to 29 nm, an increase of the BET surface area and average pore size to 16.7 m2/g and 1.26 nm, respectively, and broadening of the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) lines. The XRD patterns of silver metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) sample showed strong and narrow diffraction lines typical for powder silicon and low-intensity diffraction lines typical for silver. The metal-assisted chemical etching of starting Si material resulted in a decrease of surface area to 7.3 m2/g and an increase of the average pore size to 3.44 nm. These three materials were used as the anode material in lithium-ion cells, and their electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the sample prepared by MACE is attributed to increase in pore size, which are large enough for easy lithiation. These are the positive aspects of the application of MACE in the development of an anode material for Li-ion batteries."

      "ZnFe2O4 yolk-shell powders were prepared by applying a simple spray-drying process. Dextrin was used as a drying additive and carbon source material, and thus played a key role in the preparation of the powders. The combustion of precursor powders consisting of zinc and iron salts and dextrin obtained by a spray-drying process produced the yolk-shell-structured ZnFe2O4 powders even at a low post-treatment temperature of 350 °C. The ZnFe2O4 powders prepared from the spray solution without dextrin had a filled and pockmarked structure. The initial discharge capacities of the ZnFe2O4 yolk-shell and filled powders post-treated at 450 °C at a current density of 500 mA g(-1) were 1226 and 993 mA h g(-1), respectively, and the corresponding initial Coulombic efficiencies were 74 and 58%. The discharge capacities of the ZnFe2O4 powders with yolk-shell and filled structures post-treated at 450 °C after 200 cycles were 862 and 332 mA h g(-1), respectively. The ZnFe2O4 yolk-shell powders with high structural stability during cycling had superior electrochemical properties to those of the powders with filled structure."

      "We demonstrate a simple, efficient, yet versatile strategy for the synthesis of novel hierarchical heterostructures composed of TiO(2) nanofiber stem and various metal oxides (MOs) secondary nanostructures, including Co(3)O(4), Fe(2)O(3), Fe(3)O(4), and CuO, by advantageously combining the versatility of the electrospinning technique and hydrothermal growth method, for which the controllable formation process and possible formation mechanism are also investigated. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept demonstration of the functional properties of these hierarchical heterostructures, the Co(3)O(4)/TiO(2) hierarchical heterostructures are investigated as the lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) anode materials for the first time, which not only delivers a high reversible capacity of 632.5 mAh g(-1) and 95.3% capacity retention over 480 cycles, but also shows excellent rate capability with respect to the pristine TiO(2) nanofibers. The synergetic effect between Co(3)O(4) and TiO(2) as well as the unique feature of hierarchical heterostructures are probably responsible for the enhanced electrochemical performance."

      "The temporally and spatially resolved tracking of lithium intercalation and electrode degradation processes are crucial for detecting and understanding performance losses during the operation of lithium-batteries. Here, high-throughput X-ray computed tomography has enabled the identification of mechanical degradation processes in a commercial Li/MnO2 primary battery and the indirect tracking of lithium diffusion; furthermore, complementary neutron computed tomography has identified the direct lithium diffusion process and the electrode wetting by the electrolyte. Virtual electrode unrolling techniques provide a deeper view inside the electrode layers and are used to detect minor fluctuations which are difficult to observe using conventional three dimensional rendering tools. Moreover, the 'unrolling' provides a platform for correlating multi-modal image data which is expected to find wider application in battery science and engineering to study diverse effects e.g. electrode degradation or lithium diffusion blocking during battery cycling."

      "The majority of transport electrification studies, examining the demand and sustainability of critical metals, have focused on light-duty vehicles. Heavy-duty vehicles have often been excluded from the research scope due to their smaller vehicle stock and slower pace of electrification. This study fills this research gap by evaluating the lithium resource impacts from electrification of the heavy-duty segment at the global level. Our results show that a mass electrification of the heavy-duty segment on top of the light-duty segment would substantially increase the lithium demand and impose further strain on the global lithium supply. The significant impact is attributed to the large single-vehicle battery capacity required by heavy-duty vehicles and the expected battery replacement needed within the lifetime of heavy-duty vehicles. We suggest that the ambition of mass electrification in the heavy-duty segment should be treated with cautions for both policy makers and entrepreneurs."

      "As lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode materials, porous carbons with high specific surface area are highly required because they can well accommodate huge volume expansion/contraction during cycling. In this work, hierarchically porous carbon (HPC) with high specific surface area (~1714.83 m2 g-1) is synthesized from biomass reed flowers. The material presents good cycling stability as an LIB anode, delivering an excellent reversible capacity of 581.2 mAh g-1 after cycling for 100 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1, and still remains a reversible capacity of 298.5 mAh g-1 after cycling for 1000 cycles even at 1000 mA g-1. The good electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the high specific surface area of the HPC network, which provides rich and fast paths for electron and ion transfer and provides large contact area and mutual interactions between the electrolyte and active materials. The work proposes a new route for the preparation of low cost carbon-based anodes and may promote the development of other porous carbon materials derived from various biomass carbon sources."

      "Polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have important significance for the development of next-generation rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. However, strong coordination between lithium ions and PEO chains results the ion conductivity usually lower than the expectation. In this study, sub-micron montmorillonite is incorporated into the PEO frames as Lewis base center which enables the lithium ions to escape the restraint of PEO chains. After involving montmorillonite (MMT) into the SPEs, the ionic conductivity of SPEs is 4.7 mS cm- 1 at 70 °C which shows a comparable value with that of liquid electrolyte. As coupling with LiFePO4 material, the battery delivers a high discharge capacity of 150.3 mAh g- 1 and an excellent rate performance with a capacity of 111.8 mAh g- 1 at 0.16 C and maintains 58.2 mAh g- 1 at 0.8 C. This study suggests that the customized incorporation of Lewis base materials could offer a promising solution for achieving high-performance PEO-based solid-state electrolyte."

      "Focus on lithium-oxygen batteries is growing due to their various advantages, such as their high theoretical energy densities and renewable and environmentally friendly characteristics. Nonaqueous organic electrolytes play a key role in lithium-oxygen batteries, allowing the conduction of lithium ions and oxygen transfer in the three phase boundaries (cathode-gas-electrolyte). Herein, we report the effect of lithium salt concentrations in single-solvent lithium-oxygen battery systems systematically (using bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME)) on their electrochemical performances. The first discharge capacities and cyclabilities exhibit favorable correlations with the lithium salt concentration, of which using 0.4 and 1.5 M LiTFSI show the best discharge capacities and cyclabilities. The specific capacity of the 0.4 M LiTFSI system reaches 7000 mAh g-1, about 1.3 times that of the commonly used 1 M LiTFSI in TEGDME. Cyclic voltammetry with slow scan speeds further investigates the system stability and reaction mechanism. The surface morphology after the discharge and interface impedance after charging, which are examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), have significant effects on the comprehensive performances. Conductivity and viscosity play mutual roles in the lithium-oxygen battery performance, while the oxygen solvation has little effect."

      "In order to study the effect of interfacial wettability of separator on electrochemical properties for lithium-ion batteries, two different kinds of polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) solution are prepared and used to coat onto a polypropylene (PP) microporous membrane. It is found that the cell performance of a coated separator using aqueous slurry (WPS) is better than that of the coated separator using acetone (APS) as the solvent. The separator with flat and pyknotic surface (PP and APS) has a strong polar action with the electrolyte, where the polar part is more than 80%. To the contrary, the WPS has a roughness surface and when the PVDF-HFP particles accumulate loose, it makes the apolar part plays a dominate role in surface free energy; the dispersive energy reaches to 40.17 mJ m-2. The WPS has the lowest immersion free energy, 31.9 mJ m-2 with the electrolyte, and this will accelerate electrolyte infiltration to the separator. The loose particle accumulation also increases the electrolyte weight uptake and interfacial wettability velocity, which plays a crucial role in improving the cell performance such as the ionic conductivity, discharge capacity and the C-rate capability."

      "The emergence of wearable electronics puts batteries closer to the human skin, exacerbating the need for battery materials that are robust, highly ionically conductive, and stretchable. Herein, we introduce a supramolecular design as an effective strategy to overcome the canonical tradeoff between mechanical robustness and ionic conductivity in polymer electrolytes. The supramolecular lithium ion conductor utilizes orthogonally functional H-bonding domains and ion-conducting domains to create a polymer electrolyte with unprecedented toughness (29.3 MJ m-3) and high ionic conductivity (1.2 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 25 °C). Implementation of the supramolecular ion conductor as a binder material allows for the creation of stretchable lithium-ion battery electrodes with strain capability of over 900% via a conventional slurry process. The supramolecular nature of these battery components enables intimate bonding at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Combination of these stretchable components leads to a stretchable battery with a capacity of 1.1 mAh cm-2 that functions even when stretched to 70% strain. The method reported here of decoupling ionic conductivity from mechanical properties opens a promising route to create high-toughness ion transport materials for energy storage applications."

      "This work presents an alternative method for fabricating Li-ion electrodes in which the use of aluminum/copper current collectors and expensive binders is avoided. Low-cost natural cellulose fibers with a 2-mm length are employed as binder and support for the electrode. The objective of this method is to eliminate the use of heavy and inactive current collector foils as substrates and to replace conventional costly binders with cellulose fibers. Moreover, no harmful solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone, are employed for film fabrication. Water-soluble carbons are also utilized to reduce the preparation time and to achieve a better repartition of carbon in the electrode, thus improving the electrochemical performance. Flexible and resistant LiFePO4 (LFP), Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), and graphite electrodes are obtained with active mass loadings similar to those obtained by the current casting method. The initial discharge capacity of approximately 130 mAh·g-1 at 2 C is obtained for an LFP/LTO paper battery with an approximately 91.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. An all-organic prelithiated PTCDA/graphite cell without a transition metal is prepared and electrochemically tested. It is one of the first self-standing batteries that is composed of organic redox active molecules and biodegradable components reported in literature."

      "Separators are a vital component to ensure the safety of lithium-ion batteries. However, the commercial separators employed in lithium ion batteries are inefficient due to their low porosity. In the present study, a simple electrospinning technique is adopted to prepare highly porous polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based membranes with a higher concentration of lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (LATP) ceramic particles, as a viable alternative to the commercialized separators used in lithium ion batteries. The effect of the LATP particles on the morphology of the porous membranes is demonstrated through Field emission scattering electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectra studies suitably demonstrate the mixing of PAN and LATP particles in the polymer matrix. PAN with 30 wt% LATP (P-L30) exhibits an enhanced porosity of 90% and is more thermally stable, with the highest electrolyte uptake among all the prepared membranes. Due to better electrolyte uptake, the P-L30 membrane demonstrates an improved ionic conductivity of 1.7 mS/cm. A coin cell prepared with a P-L30 membrane and a LiFePO4 cathode demonstrates the highest discharge capacity of 158 mAh/g at 0.5 C-rate. The coin cell with the P-L30 membrane also displays good cycling stability by retaining 97.5% of the initial discharge capacity after 200 cycles of charging and discharging at a 1C rate."

      "Due to the \"shuttle effect\", the cycle performance of lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery is poor and the capacity decays rapidly. Replacing lithium-ion battery is the maximum problem to be overcome. In order to solve this problem, we use a cage like microporous MOF(CPM-5) as a carbon source, which is carbonized at high temperature to get a micro-mesoporous carbon composite material. In addition, indium oxide particles formed during carbonization are deposited on CPM-5 structure, forming a simple core-shell structure CPM-5-C-600. When it is used as the cathode of Li-S battery, the small molecule sulfide can be confined in the micropores, while the existence of large pore size mesopores can provide a channel for the transmission of lithium ions, so as to improve the conductivity of the material and the rate performance of the battery. After 100 cycles, the specific capacity of the battery can be still maintained at 650 mA h·g-1 and the Coulombic efficiency is close to 100%. When the rate goes up to 2 C, the first discharge capacity not only can reach 1400 mA h·g-1, but also still provides 500 mA h·g-1 after 200 cycles, showing excellent rate performance."

      "An exponential market growth of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) has been observed in the past 20 years; approximately 670,000 tons of LIBs have been sold in 2017 alone. This trend will continue owing to the growing interest of consumers for electric vehicles, recent engagement of car manufacturers to produce them, recent developments in energy storage facilities, and commitment of governments for the electrification of transportation. Although some limited recycling processes were developed earlier after the commercialization of LIBs, these are inadequate in the context of sustainable development. Therefore, significant efforts have been made to replace the commonly employed pyrometallurgical recycling method with a less detrimental approach, such as hydrometallurgical, in particular sulfate-based leaching, or direct recycling. Sulfate-based leaching is the only large-scale hydrometallurgical method currently used for recycling LIBs and serves as baseline for several pilot or demonstration projects currently under development. Conversely, most project and processes focus only on the recovery of Ni, Co, Mn, and less Li, and are wasting the iron phosphate originating from lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Although this battery type does not dominate the LIB market, its presence in the waste stream of LIBs causes some technical concerns that affect the profitability of current recycling processes. This review explores the current processes and alternative solutions to pyrometallurgy, including novel selective leaching processes or direct recycling approaches."

      "Transition metal oxide is one of the most promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Generally, the electrochemical property of transition metal oxides can be improved by optimizing their element components and controlling their nano-architecture. Herein, we designed nonstoichiometric Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires for high performance lithium-ion storage. It is found that the specific capacity of Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires remain 880 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles, exhibiting much better electrochemical performance than CuCo2O4 and NiCo2O4. After experiencing a large current charge and discharge state, the discharge capacity of Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires recovers to 780 mAh g-1 at 50 mA g-1, which is ca. 88% of the initial capacity. The high electrochemical performance of Cu0.6Ni0.4Co2O4 nanowires is related to their better electronic conductivity and synergistic effect of metals. This work may provide a new strategy for the design of multicomponent transition metal oxides as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries."

      "To achieve good rate capability of lithium metal anodes for high-energy-density batteries, one fundamental challenge is the slow lithium diffusion at the interface. Here we report an interpenetrated, three-dimensional lithium metal/lithium tin alloy nanocomposite foil realized by a simple calendering and folding process of lithium and tin foils, and spontaneous alloying reactions. The strong affinity between the metallic lithium and lithium tin alloy as mixed electronic and ionic conducting networks, and their abundant interfaces enable ultrafast charger diffusion across the entire electrode. We demonstrate that a lithium/lithium tin alloy foil electrode sustains stable lithium stripping/plating under 30 mA cm-2 and 5 mAh cm-2 with a very low overpotential of 20 mV for 200 cycles in a commercial carbonate electrolyte. Cycled under 6 C (6.6 mA cm-2), a 1.0 mAh cm-2 LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 electrode maintains a substantial 74% of its capacity by pairing with such anode."

      "SnS2 as a high energy anode material has attracted extensive research interest recently. However, the fast capacity decay and low rate performance in alkaline-ion batteries associated with repeated volume variation and low electrical conductivity plague them from practical application. Herein, we propose a facile method to solve this problem by synthesizing porous SnS2 microflowers with in-situ formed sulfur vacancies. The flexible porous nanosheets in the three-dimensional flower-like nanostructure provide facile strain relaxation to avoid stress concentration during the volume changes. Rich sulfur vacancies and porous structure enable the fast and efficient electron transport. The porous SnS2-x microflowers exhibit outstanding performance for lithium ion battery in terms of high capacity (1375 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1) and outstanding rate capability (827 mA h g-1 at high rate of 2 A g-1). For sodium ion battery, a high capacity (~522 mAh g-1) can be achieved at 5 A g-1 after 200 cycles for SnS2-x microflowers. The rational design in nanostructures, as well as the chemical compositions, might create new opportunities in designing the new architecture for highly efficient energy storage devices."

      "Electrodes with high conductivity and flexibility are crucial to the development of flexible lithium-ion batteries. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) LiFePO4 and Li4Ti5O12 fiber membrane materials were prepared through electrospinning and directly used as self-standing electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. The structure and morphology of the fibers, and the electrochemical performance of the electrodes and the full battery were characterized. The results show that the LiFePO4 and Li4Ti5O12 fiber membrane electrodes exhibit good rate and cycle performance. In particular, the all-fiber-based gel-state battery composed of LiFePO4 and Li4Ti5O12 fiber membrane electrodes can be charged/discharged for 800 cycles at 1C with a retention capacity of more than 100 mAh·g-1 and a coulombic efficiency close to 100%. The good electrochemical performance is attributed to the high electronic and ionic conductivity provided by the 3D network structure of the self-standing electrodes. This design and preparation method for all-fiber-based lithium-ion batteries provides a novel strategy for the development of high-performance flexible batteries."

      "Most of the current commercialized lithium batteries employ liquid electrolytes, despite their vulnerability to battery fire hazards, because they avoid the formation of dendrites on the anode side, which is commonly encountered in solid-state batteries. In a review two years ago, we focused on the challenges and issues facing lithium metal for solid-state rechargeable batteries, pointed to the progress made in addressing this drawback, and concluded that a situation could be envisioned where solid-state batteries would again win over liquid batteries for different applications in the near future. However, an additional drawback of solid-state batteries is the lower ionic conductivity of the electrolyte. Therefore, extensive research efforts have been invested in the last few years to overcome this problem, the reward of which has been significant progress. It is the purpose of this review to report these recent works and the state of the art on solid electrolytes. In addition to solid electrolytes stricto sensu, there are other electrolytes that are mainly solids, but with some added liquid. In some cases, the amount of liquid added is only on the microliter scale; the addition of liquid is aimed at only improving the contact between a solid-state electrolyte and an electrode, for instance. In some other cases, the amount of liquid is larger, as in the case of gel polymers. It is also an acceptable solution if the amount of liquid is small enough to maintain the safety of the cell; such cases are also considered in this review. Different chemistries are examined, including not only Li-air, Li-O2, and Li-S, but also sodium-ion batteries, which are also subject to intensive research. The challenges toward commercialization are also considered."

      "Lithium-rich layered oxide is one of the most promising candidates for the next-generation cathode materials of high-energy-density lithium ion batteries because of its high discharge capacity. However, it has the disadvantages of uneven composition, voltage decay, and poor rate capacity, which are closely related to the preparation method. Here, 0.5Li2MnO3·0.5LiMn0.8Ni0.1Co0.1O2 was successfully prepared by sol-gel and oxalate co-precipitation methods. A systematic analysis of the materials shows that the 0.5Li2MnO3·0.5LiMn0.8Ni0.1Co0.1O2 prepared by the oxalic acid co-precipitation method had the most stable layered structure and the best electrochemical performance. The initial discharge specific capacity was 261.6 mAh·g-1 at 0.05 C, and the discharge specific capacity was 138 mAh·g-1 at 5 C. The voltage decay was only 210 mV, and the capacity retention was 94.2% after 100 cycles at 1 C. The suppression of voltage decay can be attributed to the high nickel content and uniform element distribution. In addition, tightly packed porous spheres help to reduce lithium ion diffusion energy and improve the stability of the layered structure, thereby improving cycle stability and rate capacity. This conclusion provides a reference for designing high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries."

      "In this study, we report the high-yield synthesis of 2-dimensional cupric oxide (CuO) nanodiscs through dehydrogenation of 1-dimensional Cu(OH)2 nanowires at 60°C. Most of the nanodiscs had a diameter of approximately 500 nm and a thickness of approximately 50 nm. After further prolonged reaction times, secondary irregular nanodiscs gradually grew vertically into regular nanodiscs. These CuO nanostructures were characterized using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurements. The possible growth mechanism of the interlaced disc CuO nanostructures is systematically discussed. The electrochemical performances of the CuO nanodisc electrodes were evaluated in detail using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the incorporation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes enables the enhanced reversible capacities and capacity retention of CuO nanodisc electrodes on cycling by offering more efficient electron transport paths."

      "A photovoltaic power generation system suitable for mobile applications was developed. A SiC integrated converter with the maximum power point tracking circuit provided the smallest photovoltaic inverter in ~200 W level. The SiC-based inverter exhibited a peak direct current (DC)-alternating current (AC) conversion efficiency higher than that of conventional Si inverters. A Li-ion laminated battery was mounted in the same housing as the inverter. The weight of entire system containing spherical Si solar cell panels was well below 6 kg. Continuous operation measurements of this system were carried out using four solar cell modules connected in parallel under irradiation by natural sunlight. The total inverter efficiencies under realistic operation conditions were slightly decreased compared with the DC-AC converter values because of loss by the maximum power point tracking device. Even under unstable weather conditions, the system provided power stability without ripples. The behaviors of the output powers of the solar cell, storage battery, and inverter modules were analyzed as a function of the solar radiation power density. The substantial efficiencies of the solar cell modules were dependent on the weather conditions and were approximately 10% on cloudy days. The present compact photovoltaic power generation system with SiC device and spherical Si solar cells is viable for sub kW-class inverter."

      "Multi-phase nanostructured polymer electrolytes, where the one phase conducts ions while the other imparts the desired mechanical properties, are currently the most promising candidates for solid-state electrolytes in high-density lithium metal batteries. In contrast to homogeneous polymer electrolytes, where ion transport is coupled with polymer segmental dynamics and any attempt to improve conductivity via faster polymer motions results in a decrease in stiffness, nanostructured materials efficiently decouple these two antagonistic parameters. Nevertheless, for reasons discussed herein the synthesis of a polymer electrolyte that simultaneously has a shear modulus of G' ≈ GPa and an ion conductivity of σ > 10-4 S/cm (in the case dual ion conductor) or of σ > 10-5 S/cm (in the case of single-ion conductor) remains a challenge. This review focuses on recent designing strategies for the synthesis of all-polymer nanostructured electrolytes, and protocols for introducing a single-ion character in such materials."

      "Boosted power handling and the reduced charging duration of Li ion cells critically rests with ionic/electronic mobility. Ion mobility in electrochemically relevant grains normally stands for an essential restriction of the velocity at which the energy of a cell can be stored/released. To offset sluggish solid-state ionic transport and achieve a superior power/energy density rating, electroactive grains often need exquisite nanoscaling, harming crucial virtues on volumetric packing density, tractability, sustainability, durability, and cost. Unlike elaborate nanostructuring, here we describe that a SnO2-Fe2O3@carbon composite-which adopts a metal oxide particles-intercalated bulk-like configuration-can insert many Li+ ions at elevated speeds, despite its micro-dimensionality. Analysis of charge transport kinetics in this tailor-made architecture unveils both much improved ion travel through compact monolithic substances and the greatly enhanced ion access to surfaces of SnO2/Fe2O3 grains. According to the well-studied battery degradation mechanism, it is that both the effective stress management and internal electric field in our as-prepared sample that result in recommendable capacity, rate behavior, and cyclic lifespan (exhibiting a high reversible capacity of 927 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 95.1% after 100 cycles and an ultra-stable capacity of 429 mAh g-1 even over 1800 cycles at 3 A g-1). Unique materials and working rationale which ensure the swift (de)lithiation of such micrometer-dimensional monoliths may open a door for various high-power/density usages."

      "A new design strategy for high-performance organic cathode active materials for lithium-ion batteries is presented, which involves the assembly of redox-active organic molecules with a crystalline porous structure using mixed-stacked charge-transfer (CT) complexes. Hexahydroxytriphenylene was used as a donor molecule and 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexacarbonitrile as an acceptor molecule to give a new porous CT complex (PCT-1) with a pseudo-hexagonal mixed columnar structure. X-ray diffraction measurements and sorption experiments demonstrated that the intercolumnar spaces in PCT-1 can incorporate various molecules accompanied by lattice expansion. A lithium metal battery containing PCT-1 as a cathode active material exhibited a high capacity of 288 mA h g-1 at 500 mA g-1, and this performance was attributed to a combination of the redox-active units and the porous structure of PCT-1."

      "We report a computational study on 3d transition-metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co) carbodiimides in Li- and Na-ion batteries. The obtained cell voltages semi-quantitatively fit the experiments, highlighting the practicality of PBE+U as an approach for modeling the conversion-reaction mechanism of the FeNCN archetype with lithium and sodium. Also, the calculated voltage profiles agree satisfactorily with experiment both for full (Li-ion battery) and partial (Na-ion battery) discharge, even though experimental atomistic knowledge is missing up to now. Moreover, we rationalize the structural preference of intermediate ternaries and their characteristic lowering in the voltage profile using chemical-bonding and Mulliken-charge analysis. The formation of such ternary intermediates for the lithiation of FeNCN and the contribution of at least one ternary intermediate is also confirmed experimentally. This theoretical approach, aided by experimental findings, supports the atomistic exploration of electrode materials governed by conversion reactions."

      "Superior sodium-ion-conducting polymer poly(vinyledene fluoride)-silicon dioxide (PVdF-SiO2) composite separator membrane was prepared via simple phase inversion method, which is a suitable alternative conventional polypropylene membrane. Basically, PVdF is the promising for use as high porous polymer electrolyte membrane due to its high dielectric constant ( = 8.4). In this work, we prepared a composite membrane using PVdF-SiO2 via phase inversion method. This work was systematically studied towards the morphology, porosity, and electrochemical properties of as prepared membrane. The electrolyte uptake capability of separator membrane tested with 1 M NaPF6 electrolyte solution and temperature-dependent ionic conduction test were performed at various temperatures. This membrane exhibits higher ionic conductivity of 4.7 × 10-2 S cm-1 at room temperature. The physical properties were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, and FE-SEM micrographs analyses. The electrochemical performances with impedance analysis carried for prepared membrane with the as-prepared sodium P2-type cathode material. The material showed an initial discharge capacity of 178 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C between 2 and 4 V with 98% columbic efficiency and 81% capacity retention after 50 cycles upon using the as-prepared PVdF-SiO2 composite separator membrane."

      "The drawbacks of low porosity, inferior electrolyte wettability, low thermal dimensional stability and permissive lithium dendrite growth of the conventional microporous polyolefin-based separators hinder their widely application in the high power density and safe Lithium ion batteries. Herein, highly porous polybenzimidazole-based separator is prepared by a facile non-solvent induced phase separation process (NIPS) using water, ethanol, chloroform and ethyl acetate as the coagulation bath solvent, respectively. It was found that the ethanol is suitable to fabricate uniform morphology macroporous separator with the porosity of 92%, electrolyte uptake of 594 wt.%, and strong mechanical strength of 15.9 MPa. In addition, the experimental tests (electrochemical analysis and XPS test) and density functional theory calculation suggest that the electron-rich imidazole ring of polybenzimidazle can enhance Li+ mobility electrostatic attraction interaction while the block the PF6- mobility via electrostatic repulsion interaction. Therefore, high Li+ transference number of 0.76 was obtained for the neat polybenzimidazole-based polymer electrolyte. As a proof of concept, the Li/LiFePO4 cell with the polybenzimidazole-based polymer electrolyte/1.0 M LiPF6- ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (v:v = 1:1) electrolyte exhibits excellent rate capability of >100 mAh g-1 at 6 C (1 C = 170 mA g-1) and superior cycle stability of 1000 cycles."

      "Electrochemical pre-doping of a silicon electrode was investigated to create a new class of rechargeable battery with higher energy density. The electrochemical reaction during pre-doping formed a high-quality solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the surface of silicon particles, which improved the charge and discharge cycle life with a small irreversible capacity. The surface composition of the pre-doped silicon particles was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), solid state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Pressurization promoted SEI growth and lithium binding with silicon to form Li15Si4 accompanied by the reductive reaction product of Li2CO3 originated from electrolyte. The Li15Si4 was highly stable when the silicon anode was used in a full cell, thus resulting in a silicon anode with a long cycle life."

      "While high sulfur loading has been pursued as a key parameter to build realistic high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries, less attention has been paid to the cathode porosity, which is much higher in sulfur/carbon composite cathodes than in traditional lithium-ion battery electrodes. For high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries, a dense electrode with low porosity is desired to minimize electrolyte intake, parasitic weight, and cost. Here we report the profound impact on the discharge polarization, reversible capacity, and cell cycling life of lithium-sulfur batteries by decreasing cathode porosities from 70 to 40%. According to the developed mechanism-based analytical model, we demonstrate that sulfur utilization is limited by the solubility of lithium-polysulfides and further conversion from lithium-polysulfides to Li2S is limited by the electronically accessible surface area of the carbon matrix. Finally, we predict an optimized cathode porosity to maximize the cell level volumetric energy density without sacrificing the sulfur utilization."

      "With a recent increase in interest in metal-gas batteries, the lithium-carbon dioxide cell has attracted considerable attention because of its extraordinary carbon dioxide-capture ability during the discharge process and its potential application as a power source for Mars exploration. However, owing to the stable lithium carbonate discharge product, the cell enables operation only at low current densities, which significantly limits the application of lithium-carbon dioxide batteries and effective carbon dioxide-capture cells. Here, we investigate a high-performance lithium-carbon dioxide cell using a quinary molten salt electrolyte and ruthenium nanoparticles on the carbon cathode. The nitrate-based molten salt electrolyte allows us to observe the enhanced carbon dioxide-capture rate and the reduced discharge-charge over-potential gap with that of conventional lithium-carbon dioxide cells. Furthermore, owing to the ruthernium catalyst, the cell sustains its performance over more than 300 cycles at a current density of 10.0 A g-1 and exhibits a peak power density of 33.4 mW cm-2."

      "We demonstrate a facile, two-step coating/calcination approach to grow a uniform MnO nanoparticle@mesoporous carbon (MnO@C) composite on conducting substrates, by direct coating of the Mn-oleate precursor solution without any conducting/binding reagents, and subsequent thermal calcination. The monodispersed, sub-10 nm MnO nanoparticles offer high theoretical energy storage capacities and catalytic properties, and the mesoporous carbon coating allows for enhanced electrolyte transport and charge transfer towards/from MnO surface. In addition, the direct growth and attachment of the MnO@C nanocomposite in the supporting conductive substrates provide much reduced contact resistances and efficient charge transfer. These excellent features allow the use of MnO@C nanocomposites as lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor electrodes for energy storage, with high reversible capacity at large current densities, as well as excellent cycling and mechanical stabilities. Moreover, this MnO@C nanocomposite has also demonstrated a high sensitivity for H2O2 detection, and also exhibited attractive potential for the tumor cell analysis."

      "In recent years, there has been an upsurge in the study of novel and alternative energy storage devices beyond lithium-based systems due to the exponential increase in price of lithium. Sodium (Na) metal-based batteries can be a possible alternative to lithium-based batteries due to the similar electrochemical voltage of Na and Li together with the thousand times higher natural abundance of Na compared to Li. Though two different kinds of Na-O2 batteries have been studied specifically based on electrolytes until now, very recently, a hybrid Na-air cell has shown distinctive advantage over nonaqueous cell systems. Hybrid Na-air batteries provide a fundamental advantage due to the formation of highly soluble discharge product (sodium hydroxide) which leads to low overpotentials for charge and discharge processes, high electrical energy efficiency, and good cyclic stability. Herein, the current status and challenges associated with hybrid Na-air batteries are reported. Also, a brief description of nonaqueous Na-O2 batteries and its close competition with hybrid Na-air batteries are provided."

      "Recently, two-dimensional MXenes and MXene-based nanocomposites have become the most important electrode materials because of their unique physical and chemical characteristics. As the electrode of a lithium-ion capacitor, MXenes have exhibited metallic conductivity and plastic layer structure that provide more chemically active interfaces and shortened ion-diffusion lengths, and thus the unbalanced ion kinetics between the anode and cathode can be effectively alleviated. In order to further improve the electrochemical performance of MXenes, the composition, morphology and texture, surface chemistry, and structural configuration of MXenes are extensively investigated. In this mini-review, some recent research and progress of MXenes and MXene-based nanocomposites in lithium-ion capacitors are summarized, which focus on their nanostructure designs and chemical preparation methods, such as prepillaring MXenes, delaminated MXenes, and MXene-based hybrids. Finally, some future perspectives and critical challenges of MXene-based material for lithium-ion capacitor application are also presented and briefly discussed."

      "Among the 3D-printing technologies, fused deposition modeling (FDM) represents a promising route to enable direct incorporation of the battery within the final 3D object. Here, the preparation and characterization of lithium iron phosphate/polylactic acid (LFP/PLA) and SiO2/PLA 3D-printable filaments, specifically conceived respectively as positive electrode and separator in a lithium-ion battery is reported. By means of plasticizer addition, the active material loading within the positive electrode is raised as high as possible (up to 52 wt.%) while still providing enough flexibility to the filament to be printed. A thorough analysis is performed to determine the thermal, electrical and electrochemical effect of carbon black as conductive additive in the positive electrode and the electrolyte uptake impact of ceramic additives in the separator. Considering both optimized filaments composition and using our previously reported graphite/PLA filament for the negative electrode, assembled and \"printed in one-shot\" complete LFP/Graphite battery cells are 3D-printed and characterized. Taking advantage of the new design capabilities conferred by 3D-printing, separator patterns and infill density are discussed with a view to enhance the liquid electrolyte impregnation and avoid short-circuits."

      "Hydronium-ion batteries are regarded as one of the most promising energy technologies as next-generation power sources, benefiting from their cost effectivity and sustainability merits. Herein, we propose a hydronium-ion battery which is based on an organic pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone anode and an inorganic MnO2@graphite felt cathode in an acid electrolyte. Its operation involves a quinone/hydroquinone redox reaction on anode and a MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction on cathode, in parallel with the transfer of H3O+ between two electrodes. The distinct operation mechanism affords this hydronium-ion battery an energy density up to 132.6 Wh kg-1 and a supercapacitor-comparable power density of 30.8 kW kg-1, along with a long-term cycling life over 5000 cycles. Furthermore, surprisingly, this hydronium-ion battery works well even with a frozen electrolyte under -40 °C, and superior rate performance and cycle stability remain at -70 °C."

      "We present a novel concept to achieve high performance and high safety simultaneously by passivating a Li-ion cell and then self-heating before use. By adding a small amount of triallyl phosphate in conventional electrolytes, we show that resistances of the passivated cells can increase by ~5×, thereby ensuring high safety and thermal stability. High power before battery operation is delivered by self-heating to an elevated temperature such as 60°C within tens of seconds. The present approach of building a resistive cell with highly stable materials and then delivering high power on demand through rapid thermal stimulation leads to a revolutionary route to high safety when batteries are not in use and high battery performance upon operation."

      "Due to their exceptional high energy density, lithium-ion batteries are of central importance in many modern electrical devices. A serious limitation, however, is the slow charging rate used to obtain the full capacity. Thus far, there have been no ways to increase the charging rate without losses in energy density and electrochemical performance. Here we show that the charging rate of a cathode can be dramatically increased via interaction with white light. We find that a direct exposure of light to an operating LiMn2O4 cathode during charging leads to a remarkable lowering of the battery charging time by a factor of two or more. This enhancement is enabled by the induction of a microsecond long-lived charge separated state, consisting of Mn4+ (hole) plus electron. This results in more oxidized metal centers and ejected lithium ions are created under light and with voltage bias. We anticipate that this discovery could pave the way to the development of new fast recharging battery technologies."

      "Although the successful deployment of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in various fields such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles and electric grid, the efforts are still ongoing to pursue the next-generation battery systems with higher energy densities. Interest has been increasing in the batteries relying on the multivalent-ions such as Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+, because of the higher volumetric energy densities than those of monovalent-ion batteries including LIBs and Na-ion batteries. Among them, magnesium batteries have attracted much attention due to the promising characteristics of Mg anode: a low redox potential (-2.356 V vs. SHE), a high volumetric energy density (3,833 mAh cm-3), atmospheric stability and the earth-abundance. However, the development of Mg batteries has progressed little since the first Mg-ion rechargeable battery was reported in 2000. A severe technological bottleneck concerns the organic electrolytes, which have limited compatibility with Mg anode and form an Mg-ion insulating passivation layer on the anode surface. Consequently, beneficial to the good chemical and mechanical stability, Mg-ion solid electrolyte should be a promising alternative to the liquid electrolyte. Herein, a mini review is presented to focus on the recent development of Mg-ion solid conductor. The performances and the limitations were also discussed in the review. We hope that the mini review could provide a quick grasp of the challenges in the area and inspire researchers to develop applicable solid electrolyte candidates for Mg batteries."

      "Inferior charge transport in insulating and bulk discharge products is one of the main factors resulting in poor cycling stability of lithium-oxygen batteries with high overpotential and large capacity decay. Here we report a two-step oxygen reduction approach by pre-depositing a potassium carbonate layer on the cathode surface in a potassium-oxygen battery to direct the growth of defective film-like discharge products in the successive cycling of lithium-oxygen batteries. The formation of defective film with improved charge transport and large contact area with a catalyst plays a critical role in the facile decomposition of discharge products and the sustained stability of the battery. Multistaged discharge constructing lithium peroxide-based heterostructure with band discontinuities and a relatively low lithium diffusion barrier may be responsible for the growth of defective film-like discharge products. This strategy offers a promising route for future development of cathode catalysts that can be used to extend the cycling life of lithium-oxygen batteries."

      "Gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is a promising candidate for lithium-ion batteries due to its adhesion property (like a solid), diffusion property (like a liquid), and inhibition of the growth of lithium dendrite. In this paper, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethyl acrylate (EOEOEA) and LiBF4 electrolyte were mixed as precursors of gel polymer electrolytes. Through thermal curing, a thermally stable GPE with high ionic conductivity (5.60 × 10-4 s/cm at 30 °C) and wide room temperature electrochemical window (4.65 V) was prepared, and the properties of the GPE were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), AC impedance spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric analysis (TG), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. On the basis of the in-situ deep polymerization on a LiFePO4 electrode and cellulose membrane in a battery case, EOEOEA-based GPE could be derived on both LiFePO4 electrode and cellulose membrane. Meanwhile, the contact between GPE, LiFePO4 electrode, and lithium electrode was promoted. The capacity retention rate of the as-prepared LiBF4-EOEOEA 30% gel lithium battery reached 100% under the condition of 0.1 °C after 50 cycles, and the Coulombic efficiency was over 99%. Meanwhile, the growth of lithium dendrite could be effectively inhibited. GPE can be applied in high-performance lithium batteries."

      "The garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) has been widely investigated because of its high conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and chemical stability with regards to lithium metal. However, the usual preparation process of LLZO requires high-temperature sintering for a long time and a lot of mother powder to compensate for lithium evaporation. In this study submicron Li6.6La3Zr1.6Nb0.4O12 (LLZNO) powder-which has a stable cubic phase and high sintering activity-was prepared using the conventional solid-state reaction and the attrition milling process, and Li stoichiometric LLZNO ceramics were obtained by sintering this powder-which is difficult to control under high sintering temperatures and when sintered for a long time-at a relatively low temperature or for a short amount of time. The particle-size distribution, phase structure, microstructure, distribution of elements, total ionic conductivity, relative density, and activation energy of the submicron LLZNO powder and the LLZNO ceramics were tested and analyzed using laser diffraction particle-size analyzer (LD), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and the Archimedean method. The total ionic conductivity of samples sintered at 1200 °C for 30 min was 5.09 × 10-4 S·cm-1, the activation energy was 0.311 eV, and the relative density was 87.3%. When the samples were sintered at 1150 °C for 60 min the total ionic conductivity was 3.49 × 10-4 S·cm-1, the activation energy was 0.316 eV, and the relative density was 90.4%. At the same time, quasi-solid-state batteries were assembled with LiMn2O4 as the positive electrode and submicron LLZNO powder as the solid-state electrolyte. After 50 cycles, the discharge specific capacity was 105.5 mAh/g and the columbic efficiency was above 95%."

      "Polyethylene (PE) membranes coated with nano-Al2O3 have been improved with water-dispersed poly(p-phenylene terephthamide) (PPTA). From the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, it can be seen that a layer with a honeycombed porous structure is formed on the membrane. The thus-formed composite separator imbibed with the electrolyte solution has an ionic conductivity of 0.474 mS/cm with an electrolyte uptake of 335%. At 175 °C, the assembled battery from the synthesized composite separator explodes at 3200 s, which is five times longer than the battery assembled from an Al2O3-coated polyethylene (PE) membrane. The open circuit voltage of the assembled battery using a composite separator drops to zero at 600 s at an operating temperature of 185 °C, while the explosion of the battery with Al2O3-coated PE occurs at 250 s. More importantly, the interface resistance of the cell assembled from the composite separator decreases to 65 Ω. Hence, as the discharge rate increases from 0.2 to 1.0 C, the discharge capacity of the battery using composite separator retains 93.5%. Under 0.5 C, the discharge capacity retention remains 99.4% of its initial discharge capacity after 50 charge-discharge cycles. The results described here demonstrate that Al2O3/PPTA-coated polyethylene membranes have superior thermal stability and ion diffusion."

      "To improve the thermal shrinkage and ionic conductivity of the separator for lithium-ion batteries, adding carboxylic titanium dioxide nanofiber materials into the matrix is proposed as an effective strategy. In this regard, a poly(vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoro propylene)/dibutyl phthalate/carboxylic titanium dioxide (PVDF-HFP/DBP/C-TiO2) composite separator is prepared with the phase inversion method. When the content of TiO2 nanofibers reaches 5%, the electrochemical performance of the battery and ion conductivity of the separator are optimal. The PVDF-HFP/DBP/C-TiO2 (5%) composite separator shows about 55.5% of porosity and 277.9% of electrolyte uptake. The PVDF-HFP/DBP/C-TiO2 (5%) composite separator has a superior ionic conductivity of 1.26 × 10 -3 S cm-1 and lower interface impedance at room temperature, which brings about better cycle and rate performance. In addition, the cell assembled with a PVDF-HFP/DBP/C-TiO2 separator can be charged or discharged normally and has an outstanding discharge capacity of about 150 mAh g-1 at 110 °C. The battery assembled with the PVDF-HFP/DBP/C-TiO2 composite separator exhibits excellent electrochemical performance under high and room temperature environments."

      "An original Von Koch curve-shaped tipped electrospinneret was used to prepare a polyimide (PI)-based nanofiber membrane. A multilayer Al2O3@polyimide/polyethylene/Al2O3@polyimide (APEAP) composite membrane was tactfully designed with an Al2O3@ polyimide (AP) membrane as outer shell, imparting high temperature to the thermal run-away separator performance and a core polyethylene (PE) layer imparts the separator with a thermal shut-down property at low temperature (123 °C). An AP electrospun nanofiber was obtained by doping Al2O3 nanoparticles in PI solution. The core polyethylene layer was prepared using polyethylene powder and polyterafluoroethylene (PTFE) miniemulsion through a coating process. The addition of PTFE not only bonds PE power, but also increases the adhesion force between the PE and AP membranes. As a result, the multilayer composite separator has high safety, outstanding electrochemical properties, and better cycling performance as a lithium-ion battery separator."

      "Composite polymer electrolytes provide an emerging solution for new battery development by replacing liquid electrolytes, which are commonly complexes of polyethylene oxide (PEO) with ceramic fillers. However, the agglomeration of fillers and weak interaction restrict their conductivities. By contrast with the prevailing methods of blending preformed ceramic fillers within the polymer matrix, here we proposed an in situ synthesis method of SiO2 nanoparticles in the PEO matrix. In this case, robust chemical interactions between SiO2 nanoparticles, lithium salt and PEO chains were induced by the in situ non-hydrolytic sol gel process. The in situ synthesized nanocomposite polymer electrolyte delivered an impressive ionic conductivity of ~1.1 × 10-4 S cm-1 at 30 °C, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the preformed synthesized composite polymer electrolyte. In addition, an extended electrochemical window of up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+ was achieved. The Li/nanocomposite polymer electrolyte/Li symmetric cell demonstrated a stable long-term cycling performance of over 700 h at 0.01-0.1 mA cm-2 without short circuiting. The all-solid-state battery consisting of the nanocomposite polymer electrolyte, Li metal and LiFePO4 provides a discharge capacity of 123.5 mAh g-1, a Coulombic efficiency above 99% and a good capacity retention of 70% after 100 cycles."

      "In this study, micro/nanoscale LiFePO4/graphene composites are synthesized successfully using a one-step microwave heating method. One-step microwave heating can simplify the reduction step of graphene oxide and provide a convenient, economical, and effective method of preparing graphene composites. The structural analysis shows that LiFePO4/graphene has high phase purity and crystallinity. The morphological analysis shows that LiFePO4/graphene microspheres and micron blocks are composed of densely aggregated nanoparticles; the nanoparticle size can shorten the diffusion path of lithium ions and thus increase the lithium-ion diffusion rate. Additionally, the graphene sheets can provide a rapid transport path for electrons, thus increasing the electronic conductivity of the material. Furthermore, the nanoparticles being packed into the micron graphene sheets can ensure stability in the electrolyte during charging and discharging. Raman analysis reveals that the graphene has a high degree of graphitization. Electrochemical analysis shows that the LiFePO4/graphene has an excellent capacity, high rate performance, and cycle stability. The discharge capacities are 166.3, 156.1, 143.0, 132.4, and 120.9 mAh g-1 at rates of 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and 10 C, respectively. The superior electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the synergy of the shorter lithium-ion diffusion path achieved by LiFePO4 nanoparticles and the conductive networks of graphene."

      "The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery has received a lot of attention because it is characterized by high theoretical energy density (2,600 Wh/kg) and low cost. Though many works on the \"shuttle effect\" of polysulfide have been investigated, lithium metal anode is a more challenging problem, which leads to a short life, low coulombic efficiency, and safety issues related to dendrites. As a result, the amelioration of lithium metal anode is an important means to improve the performance of lithium sulfur battery. In this paper, improvement methods on lithium metal anode for lithium sulfur batteries, including adding electrolyte additives, using solid, and/or gel polymer electrolyte, modifying separators, applying a protective coating, and providing host materials for lithium deposition, are mainly reviewed. In addition, some challenging problems, and further promising directions are also pointed out for future research and development of lithium metal for Li-S batteries."

      "Metallic lithium anodes are highly promising for revolutionizing current rechargeable batteries because of their ultrahigh energy density. However, the application of lithium metal batteries is considerably impeded by lithium dendrite growth. Here, a biomacromolecule matrix obtained from the natural membrane of eggshell is introduced to control lithium growth and the mechanism is motivated by how living organisms regulate the orientation of inorganic crystals in biomineralization. Specifically, cryo-electron microscopy is utilized to probe the structure of lithium at the atomic level. The dendrites growing along the preferred < 111 > crystallographic orientation are greatly suppressed in the presence of the biomacromolecule. Furthermore, the naturally soluble chemical species in the biomacromolecules can participate in the formation of solid electrolyte interphase upon cycling, thus effectively homogenizing the lithium deposition. The lithium anodes employing bioinspired design exhibit enhanced cycling capability. This work sheds light on identifying substantial challenges in lithium anodes for developing advanced batteries."

      "The foreseen high penetration of fluctuant renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, will cause an increased need for batteries to store the energy produced and not instantaneously consumed. Due to the high production cost and significant environmental impacts associated with the production of lithium-ion nickel-manganese-cobalt (Li-ion NMC) batteries, several chemistries are proposed as a potential substitute. This study aims to identify and compare the lifecycle environmental impacts springing from a novel Al-ion battery, with the current state-of-the-art chemistry, i.e., Li-ion NMC. The global warming potential (GWP) indicator was selected to express the results due to its relevance to society, policy and to facilitate the comparison of our results with other research. The cradle-to-grave process-based assessment uses two functional units: (1) per-cell manufactured and (2) per-Wh of storage capacity. The results identified the battery's production as the highest carbon intensity phase, being the energy usage the main contributor to GWP. In general, the materials and process involved in the manufacturing and recycling of the novel battery achieve a lower environmental impact in comparison to the Li-ion technology. However, due to the Al-ion's low energy density, a higher amount of materials are needed to deliver equivalent performance than a Li-ion."

      "Architecting grain crystallographic orientation can modulate charge distribution and chemomechanical properties for enhancing the performance of polycrystalline battery materials. However, probing the interplay between charge distribution, grain crystallographic orientation, and performance remains a daunting challenge. Herein, we elucidate the spatially resolved charge distribution in lithium layered oxides with different grain crystallographic arrangements and establish a model to quantify their charge distributions. While the holistic \"surface-to-bulk\" charge distribution prevails in polycrystalline particles, the crystallographic orientation-guided redox reaction governs the charge distribution in the local charged nanodomains. Compared to the randomly oriented grains, the radially aligned grains exhibit a lower cell polarization and higher capacity retention upon battery cycling. The radially aligned grains create less tortuous lithium ion pathways, thus improving the charge homogeneity as statistically quantified from over 20 million nanodomains in polycrystalline particles. This study provides an improved understanding of the charge distribution and chemomechanical properties of polycrystalline battery materials."

      "A simple and low-cost polymer-aided sol-gel method was developed to prepare γ-Al2O3 protective layers for LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode materials. The selected polyvinyl alcohol polymer additive not only facilitates the formation of a uniform and thin γ-Al2O3 layer on the irregular and rough cathode particle surface to protect it from corrosion but also serves as a pore-forming agent to generate micropores in the film after sintering to allow fast transport of lithium ions, which guaranteed the excellent and stable battery performance at high working voltage. Detailed studies in the full battery mode showed that the leached corrosion species from the cathode had a more profound harmful effect to the graphite anode, which seemed to be the dominating factor that caused the battery performance decay."

      "Graphene nanosheets have been among the most promising candidates for a high-performance anode material to replace graphite in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Studies in this area have mainly focused on nanostructured electrodes synthesized by graphene oxide (GO) or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and surface modifications by a chemical treatment. Herein, we propose a cost-effective and reliable route for generating a defect-free, nanoporous graphene nanostructure (df-GNS) through the sequential insertion of pyridine into a potassium graphite intercalation compound (K-GIC). The as-prepared df-GNS preserves the intrinsic property of graphene without any crystal damage, leading to micro-/nano-porosity (microporosity: ~10-50 µm, nanoporosity: ~2-20 nm) with a significantly large specific surface area. The electrochemical performance of the df-GNS as an anode electrode was assessed and showed a notably enhanced capacity, rate capability, and cycle stability, without fading in capacity or decaying. This is because of the optimal porosity, with perfect preservation of the graphene crystal, allowing faster ion access and a high amount of electron pathways onto the electrode. Therefore, our work will be very helpful for the development of anode and cathode electrodes with higher energy and power performance requirements."

      "Graphene-based MoS2 nanocomposites are expected to be promising anode materials for lithium ion batteries because of their large specific capacity and high conductivity. However, the aggregation of graphene and the weak interaction between the two components hinder their practical application. Inspired by the sandwich structure, novel three-dimensional flower-like MoS2-PrGO sandwich composites were proposed as an advanced anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The separated 2D ultrathin rGO nano-sheets were connected by PEO chains and assembled into a well-organized 3D layered spatial structure, which not only avoids the aggregation of graphene but also accommodates a high mass loading of the micro-scale MoS2 nano-flowers. MoS2 nano-flowers with open architecture deliver large specific area. The rGO interlayers act as a conductive framework, making all flower-like MoS2 nano-stuffing electrochemically active. The ultra-thin 2D nano-sheets provide excellent cycle stability due to their neglectable volume changes during cycling. The 3D flower-like MoS2-PrGO sandwich composites deliver high energy density, excellent conductivity and stable cyclic performance during charge-discharge process. With a nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, their reversible capacity is retained at 1,036 mA h g-1 even after 500 cycles at current densities of 100 mA g-1. This novel design strategy provides a broad prospect for the development of advanced anode materials for superior lithium storage."

      "Tremendous efforts have been made toward the development of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries as one of the most reasonable solutions to the rapidly increasing demand for portable electronic devices and electric vehicles, owing to their high cost-efficiency and theoretical energy density. However, the shuttle effect caused by soluble polysulfides is generally considered to be an insurmountable challenge, which can significantly reduce the battery lifecycle and sulfur utilization. Here, we report a lignin nanoparticle-coated Celgard (LC) separator to alleviate this problem. The LC separator enables abundant electron-donating groups and is expected to induce chemical binding of polysulfides to hinder the shuttle effect. When a sulfur-containing commercially available acetylene black (approximately 73.8 wt% sulfur content) was used as the cathode without modification, the Li-S battery with the LC separator presented much enhanced cycling stability over that with the Celgard separator for over 500 cycles at a current density of 1 C. The strategy demonstrated in this study is expected to provide more possibilities for the utilization of low-cost biomass-derived nanomaterials as separators for high-performance Li-S batteries."

      "Developed societies with advanced economic performance are undoubtedly coupled with the availability of electrical energy. Whilst industrialized nations already started to decrease associated carbon emissions in many business sectors, e.g., by substituting combustion engines with battery-powered vehicles, less developed countries still lack broad coverage of reliable electricity supply, particularly in rural regions. Progressive electrification leads to a need for storage capacity and thus to increasing availability of advanced battery systems. To achieve a high degree of sustainability, re-used batteries from the electromobility sector are appropriate, as they do not consume further primary resources and still have sufficient residual capacity for stationary electrical storage applications. In this article, a blueprint for the electrification of a remote region by utilizing second-life lithium ion traction batteries for an integrated energy system in a stand-alone grid is presented and the implementation by the example case of a Tanzanian island in Lake Victoria is demonstrated. First, economic potentials and expected trends in the disposability of second-life lithium ion batteries and their foreseeable costs are outlined. Subsequently, key decision variables are identified to evaluate logistic aspects and the feasibility of the implementation of an off-grid electrical system in remote areas for economically and geographically unfavorable environments. The practical realization is pictured in detail with a focus on technical performance and safety specificities associated with second-life applications. Therefore, a new type of battery management system is introduced, which meets the special requirements of climate compatibility, low maintenance, enhanced cell balancing capability and cell configuration flexibility, and combined with a fiber-optical sensor system, provides reliable status monitoring of the battery. By carrying out on-site measurements, the overall system efficiency is evaluated along with a sustainability analysis. Finally, the socioeconomic and humanitarian impact for the people on the island is debated."

      "The effect of particle size and electronic percolation on low-temperature power performance in the lithium titanate (LTO) cell is reported. Particle size and carbon contents in negative electrodes are systematically controlled to understand ionic and electronic contribution. The LTO cell with a small particle size, that is, high surface area, showed superior power performance, while additional electronic percolation did not improve the performance at -30 °C when coupled with a lithium manganese spinel cathode. The results are supported by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, which indicate that smaller LTO particles exhibit lower charge transfer-related impedance and guide rational design and fabrication of electrode architectures at low temperature."

      "Recently, some studies have utilized silicon (Si) as an anode material of lithium ion battery by recycling Si from the slurry of wafer slicing dust. The filtration of Si particles condensed from Si vapors that were exhausted from the ingot growing furnace could propose another method of Si recycling. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using such collected silicon oxides (SiOx) particles as an anode material. After collecting SiOx particles, FE-SEM, TEM, EDS, XRD, XPS analysis, and charge/discharge test were carried out to investigate characteristics and usability of these particles. FE-SEM and FE-TEM images showed that these particles mainly consisted of spherical primary particles with a diameter of 10 nm or less. Agglomerates of these primary particles were larger than 300 nm in diameter. In TEM image and EDS analysis, crystalline particles were observed along with amorphous particles. As a result of XRD analysis, amorphous silica (SiO2) and crystalline Si were observed. Charge/discharge tests were carried out to determine the feasibility of using these particles as an anode material for lithium ion batteries. A cycle efficiency of 40.6% was obtained in the test in which the total number of charge/discharge cycle was 100 under the condition of C-rate 0.2 for the first three times and C-rate 1.0 for the remaining 97 times. Results showed that these collected particles could be used as an anode material for lithium ion batteries."

AATP was synthesized through a substitution reaction of acryloyl chloride. Meanwhile, poly(4-acrylamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-nitroxyl radical) (PTAm) was prepared as a control sample. Then, the structures of products were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), respectively. Additionally, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and the charge-discharge cycling properties were studied. The results demonstrated that the poly(TAm-co-SSS) with the side group of sodium sulfonate adjacent to TEMPO group exhibits a better charge-discharge cycling stability than that of the PTAm. Moreover, the charge specific capacity of the poly(TAm-co-SSS) is larger than that of the PTAm. Besides, the first coulombic efficiency of poly(TAm-co-SSS) is higher in comparison with that of PTAm. These superior electrochemical performances were ascribed to the synergistic effect of sulfonate ions group and nitroxyl radical structure, which benefits the improvement of charge carrier transportation of the nitroxyl radical polymers. Consequently, the nitroxyl radical poly(TAm-co-SSS) is promising for use in organic radical battery materials, based on the good electrochemical properties."

      "In times of spreading mobile devices, organic batteries represent a promising approach to replace the well-established lithium-ion technology to fulfill the growing demand for small, flexible, safe, as well as sustainable energy storage solutions. In the last years, large efforts have been made regarding the investigation and development of batteries that use organic active materials since they feature superior properties compared to metal-based, in particular lithium-based, energy-storage systems in terms of flexibility and safety as well as with regard to resource availability and disposal. This Review compiles an overview over the most recent studies on the topic. It focuses on the different types of applied active materials, covering both known systems that are optimized and novel structures that aim at being established."

      "This study shows the feasibility of the Electrospinning method as a process step for advanced and fast production Li ion cells. Lamination is a key technology for Lithium-ion battery production. It bares different advantages, such as a fast production line speed by fixing the separator to the electrodes. Unfortunately, this technology is inapplicable for separator and electrode formulations not based on thermoplastic binders. Using Electrospinning, this disadvantage can be overcome. In our study, beaded PVDF polymer nanofibres were spun onto a fibre-reinforced, inorganic-filled separator. This modified separator was then laminated onto a NMC111-cathode using a temperature profile of 110/110/120°C within the laminator. After Lamination, the separator was pulled-off again and placed in a SEM to see the adhesive behaviour of the applied polymer. The information gathered with SEM clearly shows a successful lamination of the separator to the electrode."

      "Rechargeable Zn-ion batteries working with manganese oxide cathodes and mild aqueous electrolytes suffer from notorious cathode dissolution during galvanostatic cycling. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the dynamic self-recovery chemistry of manganese compound during charge/discharge processes, which strongly determines the battery performance. A cobalt-modified δ-MnO2 with a redox-active surface shows superior self-recovery capability as a cathode. The cobalt-containing species in the cathode enable efficient self-recovery by continuously catalyzing the electrochemical deposition of active Mn compound, which is confirmed by characterizations of both practical coin-type batteries and a new-design electrolyzer system. Under optimized condition, a high specific capacity over 500 mAh g-1 is achieved, together with a decent cycling performance with a retention rate of 63% over 5,000 cycles. With this cobalt-facilitated deposition effect, the battery with low concentration (0.02 M) of additive Mn2+ in the electrolyte (only 12 atom % to the overall Mn) maintains decent capacity retention."

      "Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) was recently applied to the in situ and operando study of the charge/discharge process in Li-ion battery full-cells based on a pouch cell design. Here, this work is continued in a half-cell with a graphite electrode cycled versus a metallic lithium counter electrode, in a study conducted on the SANS-1 instrument of the neutron source FRM II at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum in Garching, Germany. It is confirmed that the SANS integrated intensity signal varies as a function of graphite lithiation, and this variation can be explained by changes in the squared difference in scattering length density between graphite and the electrolyte. The scattering contrast change upon graphite lithiation/delithiation calculated from a multi-phase neutron scattering model is in good agreement with the experimentally measured values. Due to the finite coherence length, the observed SANS contrast, which mostly stems from scattering between the (lithiated) graphite and the electrolyte phase, contains local information on the mesoscopic scale, which allows the development of lithiated phases in the graphite to be followed. The shape of the SANS signal curve can be explained by a core-shell model with step-wise (de)lithiation from the surface. Here, for the first time, X-ray diffraction, SANS and theory are combined to give a full picture of graphite lithiation in a half-cell. The goal of this contribution is to confirm the correlation between the integrated SANS data obtained during operando measurements of an Li-ion half-cell and the electrochemical processes of lithiation/delithiation in micro-scaled graphite particles. For a deeper understanding of this correlation, modelling and experimental data for SANS and results from X-ray diffraction were taken into account."

      "The growing demand for lithium batteries with higher energy densities requires new electrode chemistries. Lithium metal is a promising candidate as the anode material due to its high theoretical specific capacity, negative electrochemical potential and favorable density. However, during cycling, low and uneven lithium ion concentration on the surface of anode usually results in uncontrolled dendrite growth, especially at high current densities. Here we tackle this issue by using lithiophilic montmorillonite as an additive in the ether-based electrolyte to regulate the lithium ion concentration on the anode surface and thus facilitate the uniform lithium deposition. The lithiophilic montmorillonite demonstrates a pumping feature that improves the self-concentrating kinetics of the lithium ion and thus accelerates the lithium ion transfer at the deposition/electrolyte interface. The signal intensity of TFSI- shows negligible changes via in situ Raman tracking of the ion flux at the electrochemical interface, indicating homogeneous ion distribution, which can lead to a stable and uniform lithium deposition on the anode surface. Our study indicates that the interfacial engineering induced by the lithiophilic montmorillonite could be a promising strategy to optimize the lithium deposition for next-generation lithium metal batteries."

      "An electrochemical cell combining the energy storage characteristics of the chemical redox reaction and a physical capacitor effect presents advantages including high energy and power densities, and long durability. In this study, we prepared nanohybrid materials between polyoxometalate (POM) and porous carbon, which have different porous structures and pore sizes, using different zeolitic templates. The POM molecules were loaded inside the porous carbon, and these POM/carbon nanohybrid materials were used as cathode active materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The performance of these molecular cluster batteries (MCBs) was significantly dependent on the porous carbon. Operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and 7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the POM/carbon-MCBs revealed that three-dimensional porous carbon with high surface areas can improve the performance. The results highlight the remarkable performance of porous carbon with a three-dimensionally-linked pore network structure as an additive for supercapacitors to realise high-performance energy storage devices."

      "High energy density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next-generation energy storage devices. However, the uncontrollable dendrite growth and huge volume change limit their practical applications. Here, a new Mg doped Li-LiB alloy with in situ formed lithiophilic 3D LiB skeleton (hereinafter called Li-B-Mg composite) is presented to suppress Li dendrite and mitigate volume change. The LiB skeleton exhibits superior lithiophilic and conductive characteristics, which contributes to the reduction of the local current density and homogenization of incoming Li+ flux. With the introduction of Mg, the composite achieves an ultralong lithium deposition/dissolution lifespan (500 h, at 0.5 mA cm-2) without short circuit in the symmetrical battery. In addition, the electrochemical performance is superior in full batteries assembled with LiCoO2 cathode and the manufactured composite. The currently proposed 3D Li-B-Mg composite anode may significantly propel the advancement of LMB technology from laboratory research to industrial commercialization."
